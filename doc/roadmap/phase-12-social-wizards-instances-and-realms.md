# Phase 12: Social wizards, instances and realms

**Done when:** Players friend, whisper, group, trade, bank and dye. They wear titles, save outfits, pick instances and switch realms from the in-game picker.

## Review notes for this phase

The roadmap critic flagged these. Resolve each one before or while implementing the milestones it names.

- **Ordering.** 12.03 (whispers) depends on 11.03 (set bonuses) only so the inspect sheet shows stats, which blocks basic whispers behind the whole combat-stats phase. Split inspect out.
- **Ordering.** 12.23 speed validation acceptance says 'mounts never corrected', but mounts (MSG_RIDEOBJECT, MSG_SETSTOREDMOUNT, MSG_RIDABLEUPDATE in WizardMessages2) are not implemented in any earlier milestone.
- **Oversized.** 12.23 MoveBehavior/Physics observation plus speed validation across services 15/16 (S). Under-sized.
- **Correction.** 12.19/12.20 group MSG_CURRENTREALM with GAME realm messages, but it lives in GameMessages2.xml (svc 55). 12.03's MSG_REQUESTRADIALFRIENDQUICKCHATEXT is in WizardMessages2 (53). The names are valid, but these service placements are unacknowledged.
- **Handed on from 6.03.** 12.14 takes the radial menu's emotes, read from the r806919 client in 6.03. The client plays the emote on its own wizard and sends two messages: MSG_CORE_PIIRADIALMENUEMOTE, with `EmoteAnimationName` and `ExcludeOriginator` 1, and MSG_REQUESTPIIRADIALMENUPLAYEMOTE, with the animation and the `EmoteText` line it wrote. Other clients play the animation from the Emoting state that 6.03 sends for MSG_CORE_EMOTE, and show the line from MSG_PIIRADIALMENUPLAYEMOTE (`SourceName`, `SourceID`, `EmoteAnimationName`, `EmoteText`). The line is client-written text, so the server shows it only after checking it against the emote the wizard owns. EmotesRadialMenuBehavior keeps the menu's three custom pages as blobs. The player object still leaves its slot null, as in the player object the client already accepts, so the Emotes quick-chat entry has no slots to open. `client disasm 0x141e77b00` on r806919 checks identifier 0xFACEACE8 and rejects versions 4 or higher. `client types RadialMenuSlotInfo` reports each slot's index, emote GID, emote template ID, and menu chat phrase ID; the parser adds an emote slot only when its emote GID is nonzero. The pages a server writes have to match what that loader reads, and a slot's emote GID is the global id of an emote item the wizard holds, which waits on 8.08's item instances. `client template 1457184` resolves to `ObjectData/Emotes/Emote0_Fresh.xml`, which carries `CustomEmoteBehaviorTemplate`. `client template 1664452` resolves to `ObjectData/Emotes/Emote84_TrickOrTreat.xml`, whose non-default animation `P_B_Emote_Trick_Or_Treat` has bitfield -1; the catalog loads this sentinel but never considers it owned by the three purchased masks. The earlier identifier 0x0FACECE8 in this note was a transcription error. Purchased emote and teleport-effect masks are now persisted with character stats, sent in the three zero-based ranks of MSG_UPDATECUSTOMEMOTES, and included in WizGameStats. The server now indexes emote animation names from the templates and checks both radial-emote requests against the wizard's saved ownership masks. Sending the behavior with written pages, checking the line against the emote, and the real-client check remain open.
- **Found on 12.07.** Sending GAME `MSG_NOTMUTED` to an r806919 client opens `GUI_MuteFailedMsg` / `GUI_MuteFailedTitle` with "The player was not muted, but was reported." / "You can not mute that player." The probe was observed in client-driver run `20261001-232925`; keep normal unmute on the client-safe server message "You have been unmuted." and do not send `MSG_NOTMUTED` for it. In client-driver probe `20261001-235518`, with temporary probe code since removed, a filtered wizard's client obscured a word blacklisted at runtime and showed a phrase whitelisted at runtime unchanged; the real-client check reruns that from the tree.

## 12.01 Friends (WIZ-17 part 1)

**Goal:** Add, accept, deny, remove, presence.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 6.03, 5.05, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_BUDDYREQUESTLIST, MSG_BUDDYENTRY, MSG_BUDDYLISTCOMPLETE, MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADD, MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT, MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDENY, MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDROP, MSG_BUDDYDROP, MSG_BUDDYSTATUSUPDATE, MSG_BESTFRIEND, MSG_REQUESTMAXFRIENDS

**Acceptance**

- [x] Accepting an unsent request fails with CHATERROR (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.AcceptingAnUnsentRequestSendsOnlyTheSelectedChatError)
- [ ] Real client: add/accept shows both online with zone; logout shows offline
- [x] Lowering Social.MaxFriends refuses the next request over the cap without a restart (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.LoweringTheLiveFriendCapRefusesARequestThroughTheHandler)

### Detailed spec from WIZ-17: Friends and ignore lists

Players can add, accept, deny and remove friends and ignored players, see online status and location, and the lists survive relog.

**Deliverables**

- data/sql/updates/db_characters: character_friend (owner, friend, best_friend_symbol, date), character_ignore, character_friend_request
- src/server/game/Social/SocialMgr (sSocialMgr): realm-wide online presence (single gameserver process now, designed so a chat server can be split out later), friend cap from the live setting Social.MaxFriends, applied from the next friend request and REQUESTMAXFRIENDS reply, with existing friends kept when it is lowered
- GAME handlers: BUDDYREQUESTLIST -> BUDDYENTRY* + BUDDYLISTCOMPLETE; BUDDYREQUESTADD (forwarded to the target), BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT, BUDDYREQUESTDENY, BUDDYREQUESTDROP -> BUDDYDROP both sides; BUDDYSTATUSUPDATE on login, logout and zone change; BESTFRIEND; IGNOREADD, IGNOREDROP, IGNORELIST (ListData blob of IgnoreEntryData); CHATERROR; REQUESTMAXFRIENDS
- src/test/server/game/SocialMgrTest.cpp

**Client messages:** GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTLIST, GAME MSG_BUDDYENTRY, GAME MSG_BUDDYLISTCOMPLETE, GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADD, GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT, GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDENY, GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDROP, GAME MSG_BUDDYDROP, GAME MSG_BUDDYSTATUSUPDATE, GAME MSG_BESTFRIEND, GAME MSG_IGNOREADD, GAME MSG_IGNOREDROP, GAME MSG_IGNORELIST, GAME MSG_CHATERROR, GAME MSG_REQUESTMAXFRIENDS

**Database tables**

- characters.character_friend
- characters.character_ignore
- characters.character_friend_request

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit test: accepting a request that was never sent fails with CHATERROR (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.AcceptingAnUnsentRequestSendsOnlyTheSelectedChatError)
- [x] Unit test: ignoring a player removes them from friends and suppresses their radial chat to the owner (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.IgnoringAFriendFiltersTheActualWorldRelay)
- [x] Unit test: lowering Social.MaxFriends with `.settings set` refuses the next request over the new cap without a restart (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.LoweringTheLiveFriendCapRefusesARequestThroughTheHandler)
- [ ] Two real clients: A clicks B and chooses Add Friend. B gets the friend request popup and accepts. Both friends lists show each other online with zone name. B logs out and A's list shows B offline within one status update. A ignores B and stops seeing B's chat bubbles.

**Risks**

- Status values are taken from the local r806919 type dump, but client-visible status transitions and FriendInfo/Permissions semantics remain unverified until the real-client check.
- The numeric CHATERROR.Error used for request rejection remains unverified against a real client.
- True-friend chat codes (REQUESTCHATCODE/SENDCHATCODE/USECHATCODE) are planned as a follow-up milestone in this phase, kept apart to keep this milestone small.

## 12.02 Ignore list (WIZ-17 part 2)

**Goal:** Ignore suppresses chat.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 12.01

**Client messages:** MSG_IGNOREADD, MSG_IGNOREDROP, MSG_IGNORELIST, MSG_CHATERROR

**Acceptance**

- [x] Ignoring removes friendship and suppresses radial chat (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.IgnoringAFriendFiltersTheActualWorldRelay)
- [ ] Real client: A stops seeing B's bubbles

### Detailed spec from WIZ-17: Friends and ignore lists

Players can add, accept, deny and remove friends and ignored players, see online status and location, and the lists survive relog.

**Deliverables**

- data/sql/updates/db_characters: character_friend (owner, friend, best_friend_symbol, date), character_ignore, character_friend_request
- src/server/game/Social/SocialMgr (sSocialMgr): realm-wide online presence (single gameserver process now, designed so a chat server can be split out later), friend cap from the live setting Social.MaxFriends, applied from the next friend request and REQUESTMAXFRIENDS reply, with existing friends kept when it is lowered
- GAME handlers: BUDDYREQUESTLIST -> BUDDYENTRY* + BUDDYLISTCOMPLETE; BUDDYREQUESTADD (forwarded to the target), BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT, BUDDYREQUESTDENY, BUDDYREQUESTDROP -> BUDDYDROP both sides; BUDDYSTATUSUPDATE on login, logout and zone change; BESTFRIEND; IGNOREADD, IGNOREDROP, IGNORELIST (ListData blob of IgnoreEntryData); CHATERROR; REQUESTMAXFRIENDS
- src/test/server/game/SocialMgrTest.cpp

**Client messages:** GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTLIST, GAME MSG_BUDDYENTRY, GAME MSG_BUDDYLISTCOMPLETE, GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTADD, GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTACCEPT, GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDENY, GAME MSG_BUDDYREQUESTDROP, GAME MSG_BUDDYDROP, GAME MSG_BUDDYSTATUSUPDATE, GAME MSG_BESTFRIEND, GAME MSG_IGNOREADD, GAME MSG_IGNOREDROP, GAME MSG_IGNORELIST, GAME MSG_CHATERROR, GAME MSG_REQUESTMAXFRIENDS

**Database tables**

- characters.character_friend
- characters.character_ignore
- characters.character_friend_request

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit test: accepting a request that was never sent fails with CHATERROR (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.AcceptingAnUnsentRequestSendsOnlyTheSelectedChatError)
- [x] Unit test: ignoring a player removes them from friends and suppresses their radial chat to the owner (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.IgnoringAFriendFiltersTheActualWorldRelay)
- [x] Unit test: lowering Social.MaxFriends with `.settings set` refuses the next request over the new cap without a restart (SocialMgrDatabaseTest.LoweringTheLiveFriendCapRefusesARequestThroughTheHandler)
- [ ] Two real clients: A clicks B and chooses Add Friend. B gets the friend request popup and accepts. Both friends lists show each other online with zone name. B logs out and A's list shows B offline within one status update. A ignores B and stops seeing B's chat bubbles.

**Risks**

- The Status, FriendInfo and Permissions bit meanings in BUDDYENTRY are unverified.
- True-friend chat codes (REQUESTCHATCODE/SENDCHATCODE/USECHATCODE) are planned as a follow-up milestone in this phase, kept apart to keep this milestone small.

## 12.03 Whispers and inspect (WIZ-18)

**Goal:** Private messages and character sheet.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 12.02, 11.03

**Client messages:** MSG_REQUESTDIRECTEDCHAT, MSG_DIRECTEDCHAT, MSG_DIRECTEDCHATFAIL, MSG_REQUESTDIRECTEDQUICKCHAT, MSG_DIRECTEDQUICKCHAT, MSG_REQUESTDIRECTEDQUICKCHATEXT, MSG_DIRECTEDQUICKCHATEXT, MSG_BUDDYSTATS, MSG_REQUESTRADIALFRIENDQUICKCHATEXT

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Whisper to an ignoring player gives DIRECTEDCHATFAIL
- [ ] Real client: cross-zone whisper; portrait opens sheet with level, school, gear

### Detailed spec from WIZ-18: Whispers and player inspect

Players can send private messages to friends and open another player's character sheet (stats, gear, level).

**Deliverables**

- GAME REQUESTDIRECTEDCHAT -> DIRECTEDCHAT to the target (blocked by ignore, offline or permissions -> DIRECTEDCHATFAIL); REQUESTDIRECTEDQUICKCHAT/EXT -> DIRECTEDQUICKCHAT/EXT; WIZARD2 REQUESTRADIALFRIENDQUICKCHATEXT
- GAME BUDDYSTATS request/response with StatBlock (WizGameStats), CharBlock, EquipBlock (public items), EffectBlock, PetStatBlock, CRC fields so the client can skip unchanged blocks
- Reuse of SocialMgr presence for cross-zone delivery

**Client messages:** GAME MSG_REQUESTDIRECTEDCHAT, GAME MSG_DIRECTEDCHAT, GAME MSG_DIRECTEDCHATFAIL, GAME MSG_REQUESTDIRECTEDQUICKCHAT, GAME MSG_DIRECTEDQUICKCHAT, GAME MSG_REQUESTDIRECTEDQUICKCHATEXT, GAME MSG_DIRECTEDQUICKCHATEXT, GAME MSG_BUDDYSTATS, WIZARD2 MSG_REQUESTRADIALFRIENDQUICKCHATEXT

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: a whisper to an ignoring player yields DIRECTEDCHATFAIL and no delivery
- [ ] Unit test: BUDDYSTATS blocks round-trip through the ObjectProperty codec and CRCs match
- [ ] Two real clients in different zones: A whispers B from the friends list and B sees the message in the chat log marked as private. A clicks B's portrait and opens the character sheet, which shows B's level, school and equipped items.

**Risks**

- The CRC algorithm for BUDDYSTATS blocks is unverified.
- The reference only reads BuddyID from BUDDYSTATS (for GM selection). The full response layout is not yet observed.

## 12.04 Groups: invite, join, leave (WIZ-19 part 1)

**Goal:** Parties of four.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 12.01, 8.02, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_PARTYREQUESTINVITE, MSG_PARTYREQUESTJOIN, MSG_PARTYREQUESTACCEPT, MSG_PARTYREQUESTDECLINE, MSG_PARTYJOINNOTIFICATION, MSG_PARTYLEAVE, MSG_PARTYLEAVENOTIFICATION, MSG_PARTYDISBAND, MSG_PARTYREQUESTTIMEOUT, MSG_PARTYJOINFAILED, MSG_PARTYREQUESTRESPONSE

**Acceptance**

- [ ] 5th invite gives PARTYJOINFAILED; leader leaving promotes next
- [ ] Group.InviteTimeout change applies from the next invite without a restart
- [ ] Real client: invite popup, portraits, leave clears

### Detailed spec from WIZ-19: Groups (parties)

Players can invite each other into a group of up to four, see member info and leave or disband, and group state follows zone changes.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/game/Groups/GroupMgr (sGroupMgr): party id, leader, members, invite timeout from the live setting Group.InviteTimeout, applied from the next invite
- GAME PARTYREQUESTINVITE -> PARTYREQUESTJOIN to the target; PARTYREQUESTACCEPT/DECLINE; PARTYJOINNOTIFICATION, PARTYUPDATE (school, level, zone, leader), PARTYLEAVE -> PARTYLEAVENOTIFICATION, PARTYDISBAND, PARTYREQUESTTIMEOUT, PARTYJOINFAILED, PARTYREQUESTRESPONSE errors; PARTYLEVELUPUPDATE from the WIZ-7 hook; PARTYREQUESTMEMBERZONES -> PARTYSUBMITMEMBERZONES
- WIZARD3 CHANGEGROUPLEADER; WIZARD2 group quick chat routed to members
- Group chat channel via GAME CHANNELCHAT

**Client messages:** GAME MSG_PARTYREQUESTINVITE, GAME MSG_PARTYREQUESTJOIN, GAME MSG_PARTYREQUESTACCEPT, GAME MSG_PARTYREQUESTDECLINE, GAME MSG_PARTYJOINNOTIFICATION, GAME MSG_PARTYUPDATE, GAME MSG_PARTYLEAVE, GAME MSG_PARTYLEAVENOTIFICATION, GAME MSG_PARTYDISBAND, GAME MSG_PARTYREQUESTTIMEOUT, GAME MSG_PARTYJOINFAILED, GAME MSG_PARTYREQUESTRESPONSE, GAME MSG_PARTYLEVELUPUPDATE, GAME MSG_PARTYREQUESTMEMBERZONES, GAME MSG_PARTYSUBMITMEMBERZONES, GAME MSG_CHANNELCHAT, WIZARD3 MSG_CHANGEGROUPLEADER

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: a 5th invite into a full party returns PARTYJOINFAILED
- [ ] Unit test: the leader leaving promotes the next member
- [ ] Unit test: after `.settings set Group.InviteTimeout`, the next unanswered invite ends with PARTYREQUESTTIMEOUT at the new timeout without a restart
- [ ] Real clients A, B: A invites B, B sees the invite popup and accepts. Both see each other's portrait in the group panel with level and school. B levels up and A's panel updates. B leaves and A's panel clears.

**Risks**

- ErrorCode values for PARTYREQUESTRESPONSE and PARTYJOINFAILED are unknown and must be found by watching the client's error text.
- Multi-player mount party messages are planned, not yet scheduled, and follow mount support.

## 12.05 Groups: updates, member zones, channel chat, leader (WIZ-19 part 2)

**Goal:** Live party panel.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 12.04

**Client messages:** MSG_PARTYUPDATE, MSG_PARTYLEVELUPUPDATE, MSG_PARTYREQUESTMEMBERZONES, MSG_PARTYSUBMITMEMBERZONES, MSG_CHANNELCHAT, MSG_CHANGEGROUPLEADER

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Real client: B levels up and A's panel updates

### Detailed spec from WIZ-19: Groups (parties)

Players can invite each other into a group of up to four, see member info and leave or disband, and group state follows zone changes.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/game/Groups/GroupMgr (sGroupMgr): party id, leader, members, invite timeout from the live setting Group.InviteTimeout, applied from the next invite
- GAME PARTYREQUESTINVITE -> PARTYREQUESTJOIN to the target; PARTYREQUESTACCEPT/DECLINE; PARTYJOINNOTIFICATION, PARTYUPDATE (school, level, zone, leader), PARTYLEAVE -> PARTYLEAVENOTIFICATION, PARTYDISBAND, PARTYREQUESTTIMEOUT, PARTYJOINFAILED, PARTYREQUESTRESPONSE errors; PARTYLEVELUPUPDATE from the WIZ-7 hook; PARTYREQUESTMEMBERZONES -> PARTYSUBMITMEMBERZONES

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: a 5th invite into a full party returns PARTYJOINFAILED
- [ ] Unit test: the leader leaving promotes the next member
- [ ] Unit test: after `.settings set Group.InviteTimeout`, the next unanswered invite ends with PARTYREQUESTTIMEOUT at the new timeout without a restart
- [ ] Real clients A, B: A invites B, B sees the invite popup and accepts. Both see each other's portrait in the group panel with level and school. B levels up and A's panel updates. B leaves and A's panel clears.

**Risks**

- ErrorCode values for PARTYREQUESTRESPONSE and PARTYJOINFAILED are unknown and must be found by watching the client's error text.
- Multi-player mount party messages are planned, not yet scheduled, and follow mount support.

## 12.06 Privacy, friendly player, teleport to friend (WIZ-20)

**Goal:** Enforced privacy toggles.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 12.01, 6.07

**Client messages:** MSG_REQUESTPRIVACYOPTIONS, MSG_RESPONSEPRIVACYOPTIONS, MSG_UPDATEPRIVACYOPTIONS, MSG_SETFRIENDLYPLAYER, MSG_UPDATEFRIENDLYWORLD, MSG_REQUESTFRIENDLYPLAYERS, MSG_REQUESTFRIENDLYPLAYERQUEST, MSG_GOTOFRIENDLYPLAYER, MSG_GOTOPLAYER, MSG_GOTOPLAYERRESP

**Acceptance**

- [ ] GOTOPLAYER with AllowFriendTeleport=0 errors, no transfer
- [ ] Real client: toggle persists; teleport refused or lands next to friend

### Detailed spec from WIZ-20: Privacy options, friendly-player and teleport to friend

Players can set privacy toggles (friend requests, teleports, trade, hatch, party invites) and teleport to a friend, with the server enforcing those toggles.

**Deliverables**

- data/sql/updates/db_characters: character_privacy
- WIZARD REQUESTPRIVACYOPTIONS -> RESPONSEPRIVACYOPTIONS; UPDATEPRIVACYOPTIONS persisted and enforced in SocialMgr and GroupMgr
- SETFRIENDLYPLAYER, UPDATEFRIENDLYWORLD, REQUESTFRIENDLYPLAYERS/REQUESTFRIENDLYPLAYERQUEST minimal responses
- GAME GOTOPLAYER -> GOTOPLAYERRESP and WIZARD GOTOFRIENDLYPLAYER, handing the move to the WLD zone-transfer API
- Refuse or allow per AllowFriendTeleport

**Client messages:** MSG_REQUESTPRIVACYOPTIONS, MSG_RESPONSEPRIVACYOPTIONS, MSG_UPDATEPRIVACYOPTIONS, MSG_SETFRIENDLYPLAYER, MSG_UPDATEFRIENDLYWORLD, MSG_REQUESTFRIENDLYPLAYERS, MSG_REQUESTFRIENDLYPLAYERQUEST, MSG_GOTOFRIENDLYPLAYER, GAME MSG_GOTOPLAYER, GAME MSG_GOTOPLAYERRESP

**Database tables**

- characters.character_privacy

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: GOTOPLAYER to a friend with AllowFriendTeleport=0 returns an error and no transfer
- [ ] Real client: in Options, turning off 'allow friend teleport' and relogging keeps the toggle. A friend who clicks teleport gets a refusal message. With it on, the friend's client loads into your zone next to you.

**Risks**

- The REQUESTFRIENDLYPLAYERS Data blob format is unknown.

## 12.07 Chat moderation (WIZ-21)

**Goal:** Filter, permissions, mute.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 6.04, 4.15

**Client messages:** MSG_CHATFILTERBLACK, MSG_CHATFILTERWHITE, MSG_MUTE, MSG_NOTMUTED

**Acceptance**

- [x] Blacklisted word flagged; whitelisted phrase passes [ChatFilterTest.FindsBlacklistedWordsAndLetsWhitelistEntriesPass]
- [x] Muted REQUESTRADIALCHAT dropped with notice [ChatHandlerTest.AMutedChatRequestIsDroppedAndTheClientIsNotified]
- [ ] Real client: '.mute <name> 5m' works
- [x] `.reload chatfilter` keeps the old lists on a failed load [ChatFilterTest.FailedReloadKeepsOldListsAndValidReloadSwapsTheWholeSnapshot]

### Detailed spec from WIZ-21: Chat moderation: filter, permissions and mute

Accounts get open or filtered chat, filtered words are handled the way the client expects, and GMs can mute players.

**Deliverables**

- login.account chat_mode (open/filtered/closed) -> ClientWizPlayerNameBehavior.m_chatPermissions
- src/server/game/Chat/ChatFilter: loads ChatFilter/WhiteListBase.txt, WhiteListPhrasesBase.txt, BlackListBase.txt, ExceptionListBase.txt and CharacterReplacementMap.txt from the user's install at startup and on `.reload chatfilter` (UTF-16), and sets the RADIALCHAT Filter byte. A reload builds the new lists off to the side and swaps them atomically, and if any file fails to load the old lists stay active and every error is reported
- CHATFILTERBLACK/CHATFILTERWHITE senders for runtime additions
- GAME MUTE, NOTMUTED; login.account_muted (until, reason, by)
- src/server/scripts/Commands/cs_mute.cpp (.mute, .unmute), cs_ban stub owned with LOG

**Client messages:** MSG_CHATFILTERBLACK, MSG_CHATFILTERWHITE, GAME MSG_MUTE, GAME MSG_NOTMUTED

**Data sources**

- Root.wad ChatFilter/*.txt (UTF-16; WhiteListBase.txt 2.4 MB)

**Database tables**

- login.account_muted

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit test: a blacklisted word from a fixture list is flagged and a whitelisted phrase passes [ChatFilterTest.FindsBlacklistedWordsAndLetsWhitelistEntriesPass]
- [x] Unit test: a muted account's REQUESTRADIALCHAT is dropped with a notice [ChatHandlerTest.AMutedChatRequestIsDroppedAndTheClientIsNotified]
- [x] Unit test: `.reload chatfilter` with a missing list file keeps the old lists and reports the error; with valid files a newly blacklisted word is flagged without a restart [ChatFilterTest.FailedReloadKeepsOldListsAndValidReloadSwapsTheWholeSnapshot]
- [x] Successful reload additions reach connected clients in CHATFILTERBLACK/CHATFILTERWHITE carrying the recipient wizard's GlobalID [ChatFilterTest.SuccessfulReloadSendsAddedWordsToConnectedWizards]
- [ ] Real client: after '.mute <name> 5m', the muted player gets the mute notice and nobody sees their chat until it expires. A filtered-chat account sees another player's off-whitelist message as filtered text.

**Risks**

- Whether the client or the server applies the whitelist, and how the Filter byte values map, is unverified.

## 12.08 Badges and titles (WIZ-22)

**Goal:** Earn and select titles.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 6.04, 10.01, 4.15

**Client messages:** MSG_BADGES, MSG_SELECT_BADGE, MSG_NEWTITLE, MSG_REQUESTNEWBADGE, MSG_REQUESTPLAYERBADGE

**Acceptance**

- [ ] No duplicates; progress clamps; LastSegment only on final
- [ ] Real client: '.badge add' shows under filter; title seen by second client
- [ ] New badge_template row grantable after `.reload badge_template` without a restart

### Detailed spec from WIZ-22: Badges and titles

Wizards earn badges, can pick one as the title above their head, and the badge book shows progress.

**Deliverables**

- world.badge_template (name, title key, info key, filter, requirements, registry name/value, auto-add, overcount) authored as SQL, because BadgeTemplate files do not appear as roots in Root.wad; badge_template and badge_filter reload live with `.reload badge_template`, keeping the old tables on failure
- BadgeFilterDescriptions.xml extractor -> world.badge_filter
- An importer for the badge templates of a CSR package the user kept from an older client, into their local world database only, each row naming the package as its source
- data/sql/updates/db_characters: character_badge (badge, progress, complete), character_stats.selected_badge
- GAME BADGES (segmented, with the BadgeInfo/BadgeFilterInfo blobs), SELECT_BADGE handler that updates ClientWizPlayerNameBehavior.m_badgeTitle and broadcasts NEWTITLE
- WIZARD3 REQUESTNEWBADGE / REQUESTPLAYERBADGE minimal handlers; the leaderboard and reward-loot badge messages are planned as a follow-up milestone in this phase
- cs_badge.cpp: .badge add/remove

**Client messages:** GAME MSG_BADGES, GAME MSG_SELECT_BADGE, MSG_NEWTITLE, WIZARD3 MSG_REQUESTNEWBADGE, WIZARD3 MSG_REQUESTPLAYERBADGE

**Data sources**

- Root.wad BadgeFilterDescriptions.xml (root BadgeFilterDescriptionList)
- Root.wad Locale/*.lang badge title keys (Badges, WizardBadges, ClientBadgeNames)
- Root.wad MagicSchools/*.xml m_secondarySchoolBadgeList
- Badges in a CSR package the user kept from an older client, for import only

**Database tables**

- world.badge_template
- world.badge_filter
- characters.character_badge

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: granting a badge twice does not duplicate it; progress clamps at max
- [ ] Unit test: the BADGES segmented sequence sets LastSegment on the final message only
- [ ] Adding a badge_template row, then `.reload badge_template`, lets '.badge add' grant it without a restart
- [ ] Real client: '.badge add <badge>' makes the badge appear in the Badges tab under the right filter. Selecting it changes the title under the wizard's name, and a second client sees the new title.

**Risks**

- The badge definitions list is server-side. Titles, filters and images are client identifiers each install resolves, and requirements are authored, as Server-side content in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md settles.
- The BADGES segment and blob layout needs capture confirmation. The private sniffer holds decoded BadgeInfoList samples for study only.

## 12.09 Bank and shared bank (WIZ-23)

**Goal:** Move items to storage.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 8.09, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_OPENBANK, MSG_MOVEINVTOBANK, MSG_INVTOBANKCONFIRM, MSG_MOVEBANKTOINV, MSG_BANKTOINVCONFIRM, MSG_MOVEBANKTOBANK, MSG_BANKTOBANKCONFIRM, MSG_BANKDELETE, MSG_BANKDELETECONFIRM, MSG_STORAGECLIENTADD, MSG_STORAGECLIENTREMOVE, MSG_ITEMOVERFLOWTOBANK, MSG_BANKCOUNT, MSG_UPDATEBANKLIMIT, MSG_QUICKSELLREQUESTBANK

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unowned move returns Failure=1
- [ ] Shared bank visible to second character
- [ ] Real client: hat to bank persists
- [ ] Bank.Capacity change applies from the next move without a restart

### Detailed spec from WIZ-23: Bank and shared bank

Players can open the bank, move items between backpack, bank and shared bank, and delete stored items.

**Deliverables**

- data/sql/updates/db_characters: character_bank; data/sql/updates/db_login or db_characters: account_shared_bank (decide which database with the maintainer)
- OPENBANK sender (house or bank object interaction), MOVEINVTOBANK -> INVTOBANKCONFIRM, MOVEBANKTOINV -> BANKTOINVCONFIRM, MOVEBANKTOBANK -> BANKTOBANKCONFIRM, BANKDELETE -> BANKDELETECONFIRM, STORAGECLIENTADD/REMOVE, ITEMOVERFLOWTOBANK, SHAREDBANKDELETEREAGENTORPETSNACK(+CONFIRM)
- WIZARD2 BANKCOUNT, UPDATEBANKLIMIT
- Enforce ClientRequestID echo and capacity; bank and shared bank capacities are the live settings Bank.Capacity and Bank.SharedCapacity, applied from the next move and sent to online players with UPDATEBANKLIMIT, with stored items above a lowered cap kept

**Client messages:** MSG_OPENBANK, MSG_MOVEINVTOBANK, MSG_INVTOBANKCONFIRM, MSG_MOVEBANKTOINV, MSG_BANKTOINVCONFIRM, MSG_MOVEBANKTOBANK, MSG_BANKTOBANKCONFIRM, MSG_BANKDELETE, MSG_BANKDELETECONFIRM, MSG_STORAGECLIENTADD, MSG_STORAGECLIENTREMOVE, MSG_ITEMOVERFLOWTOBANK, MSG_SHAREDBANKDELETEREAGENTORPETSNACK, MSG_SHAREDBANKDELETEREAGENTORPETSNACKCONFIRM, WIZARD2 MSG_BANKCOUNT, WIZARD2 MSG_UPDATEBANKLIMIT

**Database tables**

- characters.character_bank
- account_shared_bank

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: moving an item the player does not own returns Failure=1 and changes nothing
- [ ] Unit test: shared bank items are visible from a second character on the same account
- [ ] Real client: opening the bank and dragging a hat from backpack to bank moves the icon across. Relog keeps it there. A second character on the account sees shared-bank items.
- [ ] Raising Bank.Capacity with `.settings set` lets the next deposit into a full bank succeed without a restart

**Risks**

- Bank capacity values are server-side and need a source, so the defaults are live settings until one is found. The shared bank crosses databases (account versus character).

## 12.10 Player trade (WIZ-25)

**Goal:** Safe two-sided trade.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 8.09, 12.06

**Client messages:** MSG_TRADE_CREATE, MSG_TRADE_REQUEST, MSG_TRADE_JOIN_STATUS, MSG_TRADE_CHANGE_ITEM, MSG_TRADE_CHANGE_MONEY, MSG_TRADE_READY_STATUS, MSG_TRADE_RESULT

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Change after ready clears readiness; swap fails whole on capacity
- [ ] Real client: swap works; disconnect mid-trade changes nothing

### Detailed spec from WIZ-25: Player trade

Two players can trade items and gold safely with both sides confirming.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/game/Trade/TradeSession: TRADE_CREATE -> TRADE_REQUEST to the target; TRADE_JOIN_STATUS; TRADE_CHANGE_ITEM and TRADE_CHANGE_MONEY (either change resets ready); TRADE_READY_STATUS; atomic swap in one DB transaction; TRADE_RESULT
- Respect AllowTradeRequest privacy, no-trade item flags, and capacity checks

**Client messages:** MSG_TRADE_CREATE, MSG_TRADE_REQUEST, MSG_TRADE_JOIN_STATUS, MSG_TRADE_CHANGE_ITEM, MSG_TRADE_CHANGE_MONEY, MSG_TRADE_READY_STATUS, MSG_TRADE_RESULT

**Database tables**

- characters.item_instance (ownership move)

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: a change after both are ready clears readiness
- [ ] Unit test: the swap fails whole if the receiver's backpack cannot hold the items
- [ ] Two real clients: A opens trade with B, both add an item and gold, both confirm, and the items and gold swap in both backpacks. A crash or disconnect mid-trade leaves both inventories unchanged.

**Risks**

- The Status and Action enum values are unknown. In retail, trade is limited to treasure cards/items by template (ItemTemplate/ItemEnchant fields), so which item kinds can be traded needs checking.

## 12.11 Dye shop (EXT-3 + WIZ-26 dye)

**Goal:** Recolor gear.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 10.10, 8.10, 4.15

**Client messages:** MSG_DYESHOPOPEN, MSG_DYEREQUEST, MSG_DYECONFIRM

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unowned item rejected
- [ ] Real client: new colors persist and are seen by others
- [ ] `.reload dye_cost` changes the next dye's price without a restart

### Detailed spec from EXT-3: Dye shop

Players recolor equipment at the dye NPC.

**Deliverables**

- DyeShopOption service option, game/Handlers/DyeHandler.cpp
- Persist texture/decal/decal2 per item instance
- Dye cost rule in world DB, reloaded live with `.reload dye_cost` and applied from the next dye request, keeping the old rule on failure

**Client messages:** MSG_DYESHOPOPEN, MSG_DYEREQUEST, MSG_DYECONFIRM

**Data sources**

- DyeShopModifiers and dye template data in ObjectData

**Database tables**

- characters.character_inventory (texture, decal, decal2 columns)

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: dye request on item not owned is rejected
- [ ] Client: dye window previews colors; confirming charges gold and the wizard model shows the new colors, which survive relog and are seen by other players
- [ ] Editing the dye cost rule, then `.reload dye_cost`, changes the gold charged for the next dye without a restart

### Detailed spec from WIZ-26: Equipment sets, custom emotes and dye/stitch services

Quality-of-life wardrobe features work: saved equipment sets, unlocked custom emotes, dyeing and stitching gear.

**Deliverables**

- WIZARD2 UPDATECUSTOMEMOTES from purchased emote bitfields (WizGameStats m_purchasedCustomEmotes1-3) and CustomEmoteBehaviorTemplate data; WIZARD3 PII radial emote play request/response
- DYESHOPOPEN/DYEREQUEST/DYECONFIRM with gold cost; SEAMSTRESSOPEN/STITCHITEMS/STITCHITEMSCONFIRM and UNSTITCHOPEN/UNSTITCHITEMS (gold path only; the crowns path belongs to EXT)
- PETRENAMEREQUEST/PETRENAMECONFIRM (coordinate with PET)

**Client messages:** WIZARD2 MSG_CREATENEWEQUIPMENTSET, WIZARD2 MSG_EQUIPMENTSETCREATED, WIZARD2 MSG_CREATESETFAILED, WIZARD2 MSG_DELETEEQUIPMENTSET, WIZARD2 MSG_EQUIPSET, WIZARD2 MSG_MOVEEQUIPMENTSET, WIZARD2 MSG_UPDATEEQUIPMENTSETS, WIZARD2 MSG_DELETESETSWITHITEM, WIZARD2 MSG_UPDATECUSTOMEMOTES, WIZARD3 MSG_REQUESTPIIRADIALMENUPLAYEMOTE, WIZARD3 MSG_PIIRADIALMENUPLAYEMOTE, MSG_DYESHOPOPEN, MSG_DYEREQUEST, MSG_DYECONFIRM, MSG_SEAMSTRESSOPEN, MSG_STITCHITEMS, MSG_STITCHITEMSCONFIRM, MSG_UNSTITCHOPEN, MSG_UNSTITCHITEMS, MSG_PETRENAMEREQUEST, MSG_PETRENAMECONFIRM

**Data sources**

- world.item_template (m_numPrimaryColors/m_numSecondaryColors/m_numPatterns)
- CustomEmoteBehaviorTemplate data inside ObjectData item behaviors

**Database tables**

- characters.character_equipment_set
- characters.item_instance (dye layers)

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: equipping a saved set with a missing item equips the rest and reports the missing item
- [ ] Real client: saving the current outfit as a set, changing gear, then clicking the set re-equips it. Dyeing a robe changes its colors on the model for all nearby players. An unlocked custom emote appears in the emote menu and plays for others.

**Risks**

- This milestone is broad and may need to be split into three (sets, emotes, dye/stitch) when scheduled.
- Where the custom emote template list lives is unverified.

## 12.12 Stitching (EXT-4 + WIZ-26 stitch)

**Goal:** Stats of one item, look of another.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 12.11, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_SEAMSTRESSOPEN, MSG_STITCHITEMS, MSG_STITCHITEMSCONFIRM, MSG_UNSTITCHOPEN, MSG_UNSTITCHITEMS

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Different slot types rejected
- [ ] Stitch.GoldCost change applies from the next stitch without a restart
- [ ] Real client: tooltip stats vs worn look; others see the look

### Detailed spec from EXT-4: Stitching (seamstress) and unstitch

Players can take the stats of one item and the appearance of another, and later separate them.

**Deliverables**

- game/Items stitched-appearance field on item instance
- Handler for stitch/unstitch with cost and item consumption rules; the gold costs are the live settings Stitch.GoldCost and Stitch.UnstitchGoldCost, applied from the next request

**Client messages:** MSG_SEAMSTRESSOPEN, MSG_STITCHITEMS, MSG_STITCHITEMSCONFIRM, MSG_UNSTITCHOPEN, MSG_UNSTITCHITEMS

**Data sources**

- ObjectData item templates (StatsID/DisplayID template compatibility flags)

**Database tables**

- characters.character_inventory (display_template_id)

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: stitching items of different slot types is rejected
- [ ] Client: after stitching, the tooltip shows the stat item's stats while the character wears the display item's look, and other clients see the display look

**Risks**

- Unstitch rules (which item returns) unverified

### Detailed spec from WIZ-26: Equipment sets, custom emotes and dye/stitch services

Quality-of-life wardrobe features work: saved equipment sets, unlocked custom emotes, dyeing and stitching gear.

**Deliverables**

- WIZARD2 CREATENEWEQUIPMENTSET/EQUIPMENTSETCREATED/CREATESETFAILED, DELETEEQUIPMENTSET, EQUIPSET, MOVEEQUIPMENTSET, UPDATEEQUIPMENTSETS, DELETESETSWITHITEM (EquipmentSetList in ClientWizEquipmentBehavior.m_equipmentSets)

**Data sources**

- world.item_template (m_numPrimaryColors/m_numSecondaryColors/m_numPatterns)
- CustomEmoteBehaviorTemplate data inside ObjectData item behaviors

**Database tables**

- characters.character_equipment_set
- characters.item_instance (dye layers)

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: equipping a saved set with a missing item equips the rest and reports the missing item
- [ ] Real client: saving the current outfit as a set, changing gear, then clicking the set re-equips it. Dyeing a robe changes its colors on the model for all nearby players. An unlocked custom emote appears in the emote menu and plays for others.

**Risks**

- Where the custom emote template list lives is unverified.

## 12.13 Equipment sets (WIZ-26 part)

**Goal:** Saved outfits.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 8.10

**Client messages:** MSG_CREATENEWEQUIPMENTSET, MSG_EQUIPMENTSETCREATED, MSG_CREATESETFAILED, MSG_DELETEEQUIPMENTSET, MSG_EQUIPSET, MSG_MOVEEQUIPMENTSET, MSG_UPDATEEQUIPMENTSETS, MSG_DELETESETSWITHITEM

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Set with a missing item equips the rest and reports it
- [ ] Real client: clicking a set re-equips it

### Detailed spec from WIZ-26: Equipment sets, custom emotes and dye/stitch services

Quality-of-life wardrobe features work: saved equipment sets, unlocked custom emotes, dyeing and stitching gear.

**Deliverables**

- WIZARD2 CREATENEWEQUIPMENTSET/EQUIPMENTSETCREATED/CREATESETFAILED, DELETEEQUIPMENTSET, EQUIPSET, MOVEEQUIPMENTSET, UPDATEEQUIPMENTSETS, DELETESETSWITHITEM (EquipmentSetList in ClientWizEquipmentBehavior.m_equipmentSets)

## 12.14 Custom emotes and pet rename (WIZ-26 part)

**Goal:** Unlocked emotes.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 6.03, 5.05, 8.08

**Client messages:** MSG_UPDATECUSTOMEMOTES, MSG_REQUESTPIIRADIALMENUPLAYEMOTE, MSG_PIIRADIALMENUPLAYEMOTE, MSG_PETRENAMEREQUEST, MSG_PETRENAMECONFIRM

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Real client: unlocked emote appears and plays for others

### Detailed spec from WIZ-26: Equipment sets, custom emotes and dye/stitch services

Quality-of-life wardrobe features work: saved equipment sets, unlocked custom emotes, dyeing and stitching gear.

**Deliverables**

- WIZARD2 CREATENEWEQUIPMENTSET/EQUIPMENTSETCREATED/CREATESETFAILED, DELETEEQUIPMENTSET, EQUIPSET, MOVEEQUIPMENTSET, UPDATEEQUIPMENTSETS, DELETESETSWITHITEM (EquipmentSetList in ClientWizEquipmentBehavior.m_equipmentSets)
- WIZARD2 UPDATECUSTOMEMOTES from purchased emote bitfields (WizGameStats m_purchasedCustomEmotes1-3) and CustomEmoteBehaviorTemplate data; WIZARD3 PII radial emote play request/response

**Data sources**

- world.item_template (m_numPrimaryColors/m_numSecondaryColors/m_numPatterns)
- CustomEmoteBehaviorTemplate data inside ObjectData item behaviors

**Database tables**

- characters.character_equipment_set
- characters.item_instance (dye layers)

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit test: equipping a saved set with a missing item equips the rest and reports the missing item
- [ ] Real client: saving the current outfit as a set, changing gear, then clicking the set re-equips it. Dyeing a robe changes its colors on the model for all nearby players. An unlocked custom emote appears in the emote menu and plays for others.

**Risks**

- This milestone is broad and may need to be split into three (sets, emotes, dye/stitch) when scheduled.
- Emote templates and bitfield ownership rules are now confirmed, but a radial-menu slot names an emote by the global id of an emote item the wizard holds, and item instances come with 8.08.
- Pet rename is assigned to 13.02, which depends on 13.01; do not fabricate a pet or inventory ID for it in this milestone.

**Pet rename coordination:** The WIZ-26 detailed deliverable says to coordinate PET. Phase 13 assigns pet rename to 13.02 after pet core in 13.01. This server has no pet or item-instance model to establish ownership yet, so pet rename remains with that pet milestone rather than accepting an invented ID here.

## 12.15 Crowns balance and crown services (EXT-7)

**Goal:** Crowns ledger, energy, respec.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 10.10, 2.13, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_CROWNBALANCE, MSG_CROWNSERVICESOPEN, MSG_CROWNSBUYREQUEST, MSG_CROWNSBUYCONFIRM, MSG_ENERGYSHOPOPEN, MSG_ENERGYBUYREQUEST, MSG_BUYENERGYCONFIRM, MSG_RESPECCONFIRM, MSG_RENTALUPDATE, MSG_SETRENTALTIMER

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Debit atomic, never negative under concurrency
- [ ] Real client: HUD crowns; energy refill; respec
- [ ] Crowns.StartingGrant change applies to the next new account without a restart

### Detailed spec from EXT-7: Crown balance, crown services NPC, energy and respec

The HUD shows a crowns balance and crown services (energy refill, respec, crown purchases at NPCs) work.

**Deliverables**

- login DB account crowns ledger with transactional debit
- game/Handlers/CrownServicesHandler.cpp
- GM command cs_crowns (grant/show)
- Live setting Crowns.StartingGrant for the crowns a new account receives, applied to accounts created after a change

**Client messages:** MSG_CROWNBALANCE, MSG_CROWNSERVICESOPEN, MSG_CROWNSBUYREQUEST, MSG_CROWNSBUYCONFIRM, MSG_ENERGYSHOPOPEN, MSG_ENERGYBUYREQUEST, MSG_BUYENERGYCONFIRM, MSG_RESPECCONFIRM, MSG_RENTALUPDATE, MSG_SETRENTALTIMER

**Data sources**

- ObjectData/CrownItems templates

**Database tables**

- login.account_crowns
- login.crown_transactions

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: debit is atomic and never goes negative under two concurrent purchases
- [ ] Client: HUD crowns counter shows the granted amount; buying an energy refill at the crown NPC refills energy and lowers crowns; respec resets training points
- [ ] Changing Crowns.StartingGrant with `.settings set` gives the next created account the new amount without a restart

**Risks**

- Real-money purchase of crowns is planned, not yet scheduled, as an experimental opt-in setting, off by default, that hands payment to a provider the operator configures. Charging real money on a server for KingsIsle's game carries legal risk, which the operator takes on. Until it lands, crowns are only granted by GM command or the live setting Crowns.StartingGrant

## 12.16 Bazaar (EXT-5)

**Goal:** Shared stock auction house.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 10.10, 12.09, 4.15, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_AUCTIONHOUSEREQUEST, MSG_AUCTIONHOUSECONTENTS, MSG_AUCTIONRESPONSE, MSG_AUCTIONHOUSEMOREACKNOWLEDGEMENT, MSG_AUCTIONHOUSEUPDATE, MSG_AUCTIONREQUESTBANK, MSG_REQUESTQUICKSELL, MSG_QUICKSELLREQUESTBANK

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Selling raises stock; price follows modifiers
- [ ] Real client: item sold by A bought by B
- [ ] Bazaar.RestockInterval change reschedules the next restock without a restart

### Detailed spec from EXT-5: Bazaar (auction house)

Players sell items to and buy them back from a shared, stock-based Bazaar.

**Deliverables**

- game/AuctionHouse/AuctionHouseMgr (sAuctionHouseMgr) with shared stock, price modifiers and category paging; `.reload auction_house_config` rebuilds the price modifiers and template list from AuctionHouseConfig.xml and keeps the old ones on failure
- AuctionHouseEntry blob writer
- game/Handlers/AuctionHouseHandler.cpp dispatching on Command byte
- Periodic stock decay/restock timer; the interval and decay amount are the live settings Bazaar.RestockInterval and Bazaar.DecayRate, applied from the next tick

**Client messages:** MSG_AUCTIONHOUSEREQUEST, MSG_AUCTIONHOUSECONTENTS, MSG_AUCTIONRESPONSE, MSG_AUCTIONHOUSEMOREACKNOWLEDGEMENT, MSG_AUCTIONHOUSEUPDATE, MSG_AUCTIONREQUESTBANK, MSG_REQUESTQUICKSELL, MSG_QUICKSELLREQUESTBANK

**Data sources**

- Root.wad AuctionHouseConfig.xml (AuctionHouseConfig, AuctionPriceMods, AuctionTemplateIDList)

**Database tables**

- characters.auction_stock (realm-wide)

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: selling increases stock and buy price follows AuctionPriceMods; buying last unit empties category
- [ ] Client: Bazaar NPC opens categories with paging; an item sold by player A shows up for player B and can be bought; quick-sell from bank works
- [ ] Changing Bazaar.RestockInterval reschedules the next restock without a restart

**Risks**

- Command byte values and paging key semantics need confirming against the client window behavior

## 12.17 Public instances by capacity (WLD-22 part 1)

**Goal:** Soft/hard limits, '.instance list/go'.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 6.14, 4.15, 4.16

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Soft limit 2: 3rd gets a new instance, 4th joins the less full
- [ ] `.reload zone_template` soft limit change applies from the next join

### Detailed spec from WLD-22: Instances: capacity spill, private dungeons, instance switching

Busy zones split across instances, dungeons get private per-group instances, and players can list and switch instances.

**Deliverables**

- MapMgr: a public instance is picked with m_nSoftLimit as the join preference and m_nHardLimit as the refusal point; private instances keyed by owner or group id with the live setting Zone.PrivateInstanceTimeout, applied to instances that empty after a change; soft and hard limits edited in zone_template apply from the next join after `.reload zone_template`
- MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY response with RealmInfoList and InstanceInfoList blobs; MSG_TRANSFER_INSTANCE (ZoneID) switches instance through the transfer flow; MSG_CURRENTREALM (GAME2 55)
- '.instance list' and '.instance go <id>' in cs_zone.cpp
- ResTeleport flag for private-instance destinations, used by dungeon entrances

**Client messages:** MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY, MSG_TRANSFER_INSTANCE, MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS, MSG_CURRENTREALM, MSG_SERVERTRANSFER

**Data sources**

- zone_template soft/hard limit and zone adjectives
- Type dump: RealmInfoList, RealmInfo, InstanceInfoList, InstanceInfo

**Database tables**

- world.zone_template

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: with soft limit 2, a 3rd player gets a new instance and a 4th joins the less-full one
- [ ] Unit: lowering the soft limit with `.reload zone_template`, or Zone.PrivateInstanceTimeout with `.settings set`, changes the next join or the next emptied private instance without a restart
- [ ] Real client: the realm/instance picker lists the instances of the current zone with populations; choosing another reloads there
- [ ] Real client: two ungrouped players entering the same dungeon door get separate instances; leaving and re-entering within the timeout returns to the same instance

**Risks**

- How groups and parties key private instances depends on the social/party domain (EXT)
- MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS needs multi-realm support from LOG, which lands in 12.20 (realm transfer). Answer with an error until then.

## 12.18 Private dungeon instances (WLD-22 part 2)

**Goal:** Per owner/group instances.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 12.17, 12.05

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Real client: ungrouped players get separate dungeon instances; re-entry within timeout returns to same
- [ ] Zone.PrivateInstanceTimeout change applies to the next emptied instance without a restart

### Detailed spec from WLD-22: Instances: capacity spill, private dungeons, instance switching

Busy zones split across instances, dungeons get private per-group instances, and players can list and switch instances.

**Deliverables**

- MapMgr: a public instance is picked with m_nSoftLimit as the join preference and m_nHardLimit as the refusal point; private instances keyed by owner or group id with the live setting Zone.PrivateInstanceTimeout, applied to instances that empty after a change; soft and hard limits edited in zone_template apply from the next join after `.reload zone_template`
- MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY response with RealmInfoList and InstanceInfoList blobs; MSG_TRANSFER_INSTANCE (ZoneID) switches instance through the transfer flow; MSG_CURRENTREALM (GAME2 55)
- '.instance list' and '.instance go <id>' in cs_zone.cpp
- ResTeleport flag for private-instance destinations, used by dungeon entrances

**Client messages:** MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY, MSG_TRANSFER_INSTANCE, MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS, MSG_CURRENTREALM, MSG_SERVERTRANSFER

**Data sources**

- zone_template soft/hard limit and zone adjectives
- Type dump: RealmInfoList, RealmInfo, InstanceInfoList, InstanceInfo

**Database tables**

- world.zone_template

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: with soft limit 2, a 3rd player gets a new instance and a 4th joins the less-full one
- [ ] Unit: lowering the soft limit with `.reload zone_template`, or Zone.PrivateInstanceTimeout with `.settings set`, changes the next join or the next emptied private instance without a restart
- [ ] Real client: the realm/instance picker lists the instances of the current zone with populations; choosing another reloads there
- [ ] Real client: two ungrouped players entering the same dungeon door get separate instances; leaving and re-entering within the timeout returns to the same instance

**Risks**

- How groups and parties key private instances depends on the social/party domain (EXT)
- MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS needs multi-realm support from LOG, which lands in 12.20 (realm transfer). Answer with an error until then.

## 12.19 Realm and instance picker (LOG-16 part 1 + WLD-22 part 3)

**Goal:** MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY with RealmInfoList and InstanceInfoList.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 12.17, 4.03

**Client messages:** MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY, MSG_TRANSFER_INSTANCE, MSG_CURRENTREALM

**Acceptance**

- [ ] RealmInfoList with 2 realms serializes with class hash 713899438; empty InstanceInfoList non-empty
- [ ] Real client: picker lists instances with populations; choosing another reloads

### Detailed spec from LOG-16: In-game realm list and realm transfer

A player can open the in-game realm picker, see every online realm with its population, and switch realms without logging out.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/game/Handlers/RealmHandler.cpp: HandleRealmInfoQuery replies MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY{RealmInfoList=serialized RealmInfoList of RealmInfo{m_realmName, m_displayName, m_realmPopulation}, CurrentRealm, InstanceInfoList=serialized empty InstanceInfoList (must be a valid object, not an empty string), CurrentZone}
- HandleTransferRealms: validate the target realm is online and not full; create a login_key for the target realm; send MSG_SERVERTRANSFER{IP, TCPPort, UDPPort, Key(INT), UserID, CharID, ZoneName, ZoneID, Location, Slot, SessionID, SessionSlot, TargetPlayerID, Fallback*=current realm, TransitionID}; on error reply MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS{Error}
- The gameserver sets MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE.RealmName to its own realmlist name (field owned by WLD)

**Client messages:** MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY, MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS, MSG_SERVERTRANSFER, MSG_ATTACH, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE

**Data sources**

- Type dump RealmInfoList (713899438), RealmInfo (1889885615), InstanceInfoList
- Root.wad Locale/en-US/RealmNames.lang

**Database tables**

- realmlist
- login_key

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: a RealmInfoList with 2 realms serializes with class hash 713899438 and decodes back to the same values; the empty InstanceInfoList serializes to a non-empty blob
- [ ] Real client with 2 gameservers running: the realm window lists both with population bars; picking the other realm triggers a loading transition and the log shows the character attached on the second gameserver in the same zone

**Risks**

- MSG_SERVERTRANSFER.Key is an INT, while the login key is a string; the reference sets Key=0 and pre-registers the session on the target realm. That transfer-key mechanism needs its own design (for example a key table indexed by a 32-bit token).
- Whether the client needs WIZARD2 MSG_CURRENTREALM (the reference handles one in service 55) is unverified.
- It depends on WLD's zone-transfer machinery being in place.

### Detailed spec from WLD-22: Instances: capacity spill, private dungeons, instance switching

Busy zones split across instances, dungeons get private per-group instances, and players can list and switch instances.

**Deliverables**

- MapMgr: a public instance is picked with m_nSoftLimit as the join preference and m_nHardLimit as the refusal point; private instances keyed by owner or group id with the live setting Zone.PrivateInstanceTimeout, applied to instances that empty after a change; soft and hard limits edited in zone_template apply from the next join after `.reload zone_template`
- MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY response with RealmInfoList and InstanceInfoList blobs; MSG_TRANSFER_INSTANCE (ZoneID) switches instance through the transfer flow; MSG_CURRENTREALM (GAME2 55)
- '.instance list' and '.instance go <id>' in cs_zone.cpp
- ResTeleport flag for private-instance destinations, used by dungeon entrances

**Client messages:** MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY, MSG_TRANSFER_INSTANCE, MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS, MSG_CURRENTREALM, MSG_SERVERTRANSFER

**Data sources**

- zone_template soft/hard limit and zone adjectives
- Type dump: RealmInfoList, RealmInfo, InstanceInfoList, InstanceInfo

**Database tables**

- world.zone_template

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: with soft limit 2, a 3rd player gets a new instance and a 4th joins the less-full one
- [ ] Unit: lowering the soft limit with `.reload zone_template`, or Zone.PrivateInstanceTimeout with `.settings set`, changes the next join or the next emptied private instance without a restart
- [ ] Real client: the realm/instance picker lists the instances of the current zone with populations; choosing another reloads there
- [ ] Real client: two ungrouped players entering the same dungeon door get separate instances; leaving and re-entering within the timeout returns to the same instance

**Risks**

- How groups and parties key private instances depends on the social/party domain (EXT)
- MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS needs multi-realm support from LOG, which lands in 12.20 (realm transfer). Answer with an error until then.

## 12.20 Realm transfer (LOG-16 part 2)

**Goal:** Switch realms without logout.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 12.19, 6.07

**Client messages:** MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS, MSG_SERVERTRANSFER, MSG_ATTACH, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Real client with 2 gameservers: switching attaches on the second in the same zone

### Detailed spec from LOG-16: In-game realm list and realm transfer

A player can open the in-game realm picker, see every online realm with its population, and switch realms without logging out.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/game/Handlers/RealmHandler.cpp: HandleRealmInfoQuery replies MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY{RealmInfoList=serialized RealmInfoList of RealmInfo{m_realmName, m_displayName, m_realmPopulation}, CurrentRealm, InstanceInfoList=serialized empty InstanceInfoList (must be a valid object, not an empty string), CurrentZone}
- HandleTransferRealms: validate the target realm is online and not full; create a login_key for the target realm; send MSG_SERVERTRANSFER{IP, TCPPort, UDPPort, Key(INT), UserID, CharID, ZoneName, ZoneID, Location, Slot, SessionID, SessionSlot, TargetPlayerID, Fallback*=current realm, TransitionID}; on error reply MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS{Error}
- The gameserver sets MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE.RealmName to its own realmlist name (field owned by WLD)

**Client messages:** MSG_REALM_INFO_QUERY, MSG_TRANSFER_REALMS, MSG_SERVERTRANSFER, MSG_ATTACH, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE

**Data sources**

- Type dump RealmInfoList (713899438), RealmInfo (1889885615), InstanceInfoList
- Root.wad Locale/en-US/RealmNames.lang

**Database tables**

- realmlist
- login_key

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: a RealmInfoList with 2 realms serializes with class hash 713899438 and decodes back to the same values; the empty InstanceInfoList serializes to a non-empty blob
- [ ] Real client with 2 gameservers running: the realm window lists both with population bars; picking the other realm triggers a loading transition and the log shows the character attached on the second gameserver in the same zone

**Risks**

- MSG_SERVERTRANSFER.Key is an INT, while the login key is a string; the reference sets Key=0 and pre-registers the session on the target realm. That transfer-key mechanism needs its own design (for example a key table indexed by a 32-bit token).
- Whether the client needs WIZARD2 MSG_CURRENTREALM (the reference handles one in service 55) is unverified.
- It depends on WLD's zone-transfer machinery being in place.

## 12.21 Admission queue (LOG-15)

**Goal:** Queue for full realms.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 4.05, 2.15, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_CHARACTERSELECTED, MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND

**Acceptance**

- [ ] player_limit=1: second queued at 1 and released on logout
- [ ] Real client: queue position then auto-enter
- [ ] Raised player_limit admits queued players without a restart

### Detailed spec from LOG-15: Admission queue for full realms

When the chosen realm is at player_limit, the client waits in a visible queue and is sent in automatically when a slot opens.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/apps/loginserver/Realms/AdmissionQueue.{h,cpp}: a FIFO per realm; SelectCharacter on a full realm replies MSG_CHARACTERSELECTED{PrepPhase=1, Slot=<position>} (or USER_ADMIT_IND with PositionInQueue) and caches the final CHARACTERSELECTED, released when population drops
- Periodic position updates every Queue.PositionUpdateInterval; GM accounts (security_level at or above Queue.BypassSecurityLevel) bypass the queue. Both are live settings applied from the next update or select, and a raised player_limit picked up by the realmlist refresh releases queued players without a restart

**Client messages:** MSG_CHARACTERSELECTED, MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND

**Database tables**

- realmlist
- realm_online_character

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Unit: with player_limit=1 and one player online, a second select is queued at position 1 and receives the cached CHARACTERSELECTED when the first player's realm_online_character row is removed
- [ ] Real client: with the limit set to 1, the second client shows a queue position and enters the world automatically when the first client logs out
- [ ] Raising the realm's player_limit while a player is queued admits them within one realmlist refresh without a restart

**Risks**

- The whole queue UI contract (PrepPhase and Slot semantics, whether ADMIT_IND Status=0 means queued or refused) is unverified; this is the reference's behavior only. Low priority.

## 12.22 Same-connection zone transfer spike (WLD-21)

**Goal:** Test MSG_ZONETRANSFER.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 6.07, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_ZONETRANSFER, MSG_UPDATEZONECOUNTER, MSG_ZONETRANSFERREQUEST, MSG_ZONETRANSFERACK, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE

**Acceptance**

- [ ] inprocess mode WC_Hub -> Ravenwood with no reconnect, or stall recorded and default stays reconnect
- [ ] Zone.TransferMode change applies from the next transfer without a restart

### Detailed spec from WLD-21: Same-connection zone transfer spike (MSG_ZONETRANSFER)

Find out whether the retail client can change zones on the same connection, and adopt it if so, because it is faster.

**Deliverables**

- Live setting Zone.TransferMode = reconnect|inprocess, applied from the next transfer
- In-process path: after MSG_ZONETRANSFERACK send MSG_ZONETRANSFER (ZoneName, ZoneID, DynamicZoneID, DynamicServerProcID, ZoneCounter+1, TransitionID), then the new zone's LOGINCOMPLETE-equivalent flow; MSG_UPDATEZONECOUNTER for intra-cluster moves
- A written result in doc/ of which messages the client expected, whatever the outcome

**Client messages:** MSG_ZONETRANSFER, MSG_UPDATEZONECOUNTER, MSG_ZONETRANSFERREQUEST, MSG_ZONETRANSFERACK, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Real client in inprocess mode: transfer WC_Hub -> Ravenwood with the loading screen and no socket reconnect (verified in server connection log); MSG_CLIENTMOVE after arrival carries the new ZoneCounter
- [ ] If the client stalls, the spike records the observed state and the default stays 'reconnect'
- [ ] `.settings set Zone.TransferMode inprocess` switches the next transfer's path without a restart

**Risks**

- Completely unverified: the behavior reference never sends MSG_ZONETRANSFER. What the client needs after it (a new LOGINCOMPLETE or not) is unknown.

## 12.23 MoveBehavior/Physics observation and speed validation (WLD-23)

**Goal:** Settle services 15/16; reject impossible moves.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 5.03, 11.03, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_MB_MOVE, MSG_MB_MOVE_T, MSG_MB_TELEPORT, MSG_MB_MOVESTATE, MSG_PHYSICS_STATE, MSG_PHYSICS_FORCE, MSG_PHYSICS_FORCE_AT_POS, MSG_PHYSICS_TORQUE, MSG_PHYSICS_GRAB, MSG_PHYSICS_RELEASE, MSG_MOVECORRECTION, MSG_CLIENTMOVE

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Counter summary recorded in doc/
- [ ] 10x distance move yields one MSG_MOVECORRECTION
- [ ] Normal running and mounts never corrected
- [ ] Movement.ValidateSpeed toggles live from the next move

### Detailed spec from WLD-23: MoveBehavior/Physics observation and move validation

Settle whether services 15 and 16 are ever used by the retail client in normal world play, and reject impossible player moves.

**Deliverables**

- Log-only handlers with counters for MSG_MB_MOVE, MSG_MB_MOVE_T, MSG_PHYSICS_STATE, MSG_PHYSICS_FORCE, MSG_PHYSICS_FORCE_AT_POS, MSG_PHYSICS_TORQUE, MSG_PHYSICS_GRAB, MSG_PHYSICS_RELEASE (server-bound directions only)
- Speed check in HandleClientMove from speed stats (WIZ) plus a tolerance; on violation send MSG_MOVECORRECTION (float location and direction) and keep the last valid position
- Live settings Movement.ValidateSpeed and Movement.SpeedTolerance, with defaults in conf/dist/gameserver.conf.dist, applied from the next MSG_CLIENTMOVE

**Client messages:** MSG_MB_MOVE, MSG_MB_MOVE_T, MSG_MB_TELEPORT, MSG_MB_MOVESTATE, MSG_PHYSICS_STATE, MSG_PHYSICS_FORCE, MSG_PHYSICS_FORCE_AT_POS, MSG_PHYSICS_TORQUE, MSG_PHYSICS_GRAB, MSG_PHYSICS_RELEASE, MSG_MOVECORRECTION, MSG_CLIENTMOVE

**Data sources**

- Messages/MoveBehaviorMessages.xml, Messages/PhysicsBehaviorMessages.xml

**Acceptance**

- [ ] After a normal play session (walk, mount, zone, jump), the counter summary for services 15 and 16 is recorded in doc/
- [ ] Unit: a move 10x the allowed distance per tick is rejected and yields one MSG_MOVECORRECTION
- [ ] Real client: a crafted teleport-hack packet snaps the wizard back to the last valid spot; normal running and mounts never trigger a correction
- [ ] Turning Movement.ValidateSpeed on with `.settings set` checks the next MSG_CLIENTMOVE, and a changed Movement.SpeedTolerance applies to it, without a restart

**Risks**

- Mount speed multipliers and m_speedMultiplier come from WIZ; false positives would rubber-band honest players, so ship with validation off by default
- Server-side collision (collision.bcd, zone.nav) is planned, not yet scheduled; until it lands only speed is checked
