# Phase 5: The zone comes alive for one player

**Done when:** Ravenwood shows its NPCs and props where retail has them, and the HUD shows real health, mana, gold and level from the DB. Relogging returns to the same spot, and quit-to-select works without a password.

## 5.01 Template manifest and template store (OBJ-16, new DAT-2)

**Goal:** GetTemplate(id) from the user's WADs.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 3.11, 3.07, 4.15

**Acceptance**

- [x] Fake archive: cache hit/miss, missing id returns null
- [x] GetTemplate(1) is PlayerObject; GetTemplate(1652259) is the hat; first access under 5 ms
- [x] `.reload templates` swaps in an edited manifest; a broken one keeps the old map

### Detailed spec from OBJ-16: Template manifest and on-demand template store

The server can fetch any client template by template id, backed by the TemplateManifest and the user's WADs.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/ClientData/TemplateManifest: TemplateManifest.xml as a map from id to archive and entry (137423 entries), a plain path an entry of Root.wad and '|World|Part|path' one of World-Part.wad (12807 entries), refused whole with each fault named when an id is 0 or repeats, a path is empty or a piped path lacks a part or could leave the GameData folder
- src/server/game/Entities/ObjectTemplateMgr.h/.cpp (sObjectTemplateMgr), which already read the player's template, grown to every template: GetTemplate(id), and Lookup(id), which also says why a template cannot be had, decoding lazily from the archive each entry names into an LRU cache under `Templates.CacheSize`, 256 MiB by default and changed live. A template is any class derived from CoreTemplate, since the manifest lists recipes, spells, decks and sounds as well as game objects, read through typed views (ObjectTemplate::As, with the new CoreTemplateView beside GameObjectTemplateView and WizItemTemplateView), and its behaviors are the slots CoreObjectFactory::AddBehavior gives an object, as Object templates in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md records
- `.reload templates` rebuilds the manifest map off to the side from Root.wad opened afresh, validates it, swaps it, and drops cache entries by generation. Objects keep the template snapshot they spawned with. A failure keeps the old map and reports every error. `player_template` reads the player's template from its archive opened afresh and refuses one that is not a game object template
- src/tools/client: `template` reads through the same store and names each template's archive and class, and `template --list` prints every id the manifest lists with its archive and entry, marking each the install lacks
- src/test/server/game/Entities/ObjectTemplateMgrTest.cpp and src/test/server/shared/ClientData/TemplateManifestTest.cpp on an install the test builds, its archives made in memory and written to a temporary folder, and src/test/client/ObjectTemplateMgrClientTest.cpp on the user's own

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit test with a fake archive: manifest lookup, cache hit/miss, missing id returns null without throwing. `ObjectTemplateMgrTest.ASecondLookupIsACacheHitHandingOutTheSameTemplate`: the first lookup of template 7 is a miss that keeps it and the second a hit handing out the same template; `AMissingIdIsNullAndNamedWithoutThrowing`: template 99 is null, without throwing, and named as one TemplateManifest.xml does not list; `APipedPathIsReadFromItsWorldArchive` reads template 11 from Krokotopia-WorldData.wad, and `EachStepThatCannotBeTakenIsNamedAndNothingIsKept` names a missing entry, a file of another class and a missing archive, keeping none of them
- [x] Unit test with a fake archive: `.reload templates` with an edited manifest serves the new entry without a restart, an object spawned before the reload keeps its snapshot, and a manifest that fails validation keeps the old map and reports every error. `ObjectTemplateMgrTest.ReloadingTemplatesServesAnEditedManifestWhileATemplateHandedOutKeepsItsContents`: after `sReloadMgr.Reload("templates")` template 7 is the Ravenwood Captain from its new file and template 13 exists, while the Ravenwood Guard handed out before the reload keeps its file, name and behaviors; `ABrokenManifestKeepsTheOldMapAndReportsEveryFault`: a manifest with an id of 0, an id listed twice, an empty path and a piped path missing a part is refused with those four errors, the generation and cache are unchanged and both kept and new lookups are served from the old map, as they are after a Root.wad that cannot be opened; `ARootWadWithoutAManifestIsRefusedAndTheOldMapKept`
- [x] Client-gated test: GetTemplate(1) returns the PlayerObject template; GetTemplate(1652259) returns the hat; a missing manifest path is reported. `ObjectTemplateMgrClientTest` on r806919: template 1 is ObjectData/PlayerObject.xml in Root.wad, Player Object with its 39 behaviors, read through GameObjectTemplateView; 1652259 is Crowns-S58-Hats-L110-BS-008-01, the Balance hat of base cost 27250, read through WizItemTemplateView; and with the install's own manifest in a Root.wad that holds nothing else, template 1 is reported as ObjectData/PlayerObject.xml in Root.wad, which cannot be read, and template 4188 as needing Krokotopia-WorldData.wad, which cannot be opened. The install itself lacks none of the 137423 paths its manifest lists, as `client template --list` shows
- [x] Client-gated benchmark: first access under 5 ms per template; decoding 10k random templates stays within the memory cap. `AFirstAccessTakesUnderFiveMillisecondsOnceItsArchiveIsOpen`: once each of the 27 archives has been opened, the first access to 1000 random templates took 0.053 ms on average and 0.744 ms at the slowest in an optimized build, and 0.62 ms on average in a debug build; `TenThousandRandomTemplatesStayWithinTheMemoryBudget`: 10000 random templates of 30 classes, 75 MiB decoded in all, never held more than the 16 MiB budget, which kept 2140 of them and dropped 7860, and every game object template among them carries the id the manifest lists it under

**Risks**

- Templates are decoded from the user's install at run time and never stored in a database, as World threads, zone data and extracted tables in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md settles
- Settled from the client's own code: an entry of a template's m_behaviors whose m_behaviorName is empty gives an object no behavior at all, while a null entry gives an empty slot, and r806919's own templates have entries of both kinds, as Object templates in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md records. 5.02 builds a zone object's behaviors from these slots

## 5.02 Static zone objects appear (WLD-8)

**Goal:** NPCs, signs, doors, props stream on entry.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 4.14, 5.01

**Client messages:** MSG_NEWOBJECT, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE

**Acceptance**

- [x] Real client: WC_Hub statues, kiosks and NPCs stand where retail has them, nothing at 0,0,0
- [x] A Critical object zone leaves the loading screen
- [x] Missing template logged once and skipped
- [x] Log '<n> objects spawned in WizardCity/WC_Hub' matches eligible rows

### Detailed spec from WLD-8: Static zone objects appear

NPCs, signs, doors and props from the zone data appear for a player entering a zone, including objects the loading screen waits for.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/game/Zones/MapObjectSpawner and src/server/game/Entities/ZoneObjectBuilder (built in place of the GameObject.cpp this spec first named): when sMapMgr makes an instance, every zone_object row whose loading type is DYNAMIC_SERVER becomes an object with a runtime global id, a permID, a mobile id from the instance's object range and its MSG_NEWOBJECT Data encoded once, built from its template as the class the client's own factory builds for the template's core type, with one behavior slot per template behavior. The client builds the static kinds from its own copy of the zone, and sigil entries are not extracted until 6.10, so neither needs a rule of its own
- Map holds the objects; GameSession::EnterWorld sends MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE and then each object's MSG_NEWOBJECT, unwrapped, before the client says MSG_CLIENTZONED, because the client waits for the critical ones while it shows the loading screen; nothing is sent to a wizard who leaves (the client tears down)
- Critical objects: templates whose adjective list holds 'Critical' go into LOGINCOMPLETE.CriticalObjects as an unwrapped CriticalObjectList
- The world database's core_template_type gives the core type and template type of each template class, core_object_type the class each core type builds, and behavior_client_class the class the client builds for each behavior a template names
- A reload of zone_object, the type catalog, the core type tables, the behavior classes or the template manifest reaches every live instance on the next tick: added and deleted rows come and go, an object whose sources now build it differently is replaced, and GameSession::SendObjectChanges sends MSG_REMOVEOBJECT and MSG_NEWOBJECT to the wizards in it
- `extractor zones` replaces the separate zone extractor, and the game server runs the same extraction on its first start when its world database holds no zone
- src/test/server/game/Zones/MapObjectSpawnTest.cpp

**Client messages:** MSG_NEWOBJECT, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE, MSG_CLIENTZONED

**Data sources**

- world.zone_object
- ObjectData templates (DAT-2): GameObjectTemplate.m_behaviors, m_adjectiveList, m_exemptFromAOI

**Database tables**

- world.zone_object

**Acceptance**

- [x] Real client: in WizardCity/WC_Hub, statues, kiosks and NPC models stand where they do on retail, and nothing floats at 0,0,0. Earned on 2026-09-26 by the client driver's enter-the-commons.json on r806919 (runs 20260926-194353 and, on the final build, 20260926-230736): the client loads every one of the 123 objects the Commons' instance sends without a LoadObject failure, and its screenshots show the Commons' NPCs, Abner K. Doodle, Penny Dreadful and The Professor among them, standing on the ground under their names. The server sends the objects the zone's data marks DYNAMIC_SERVER, because the client builds the static kinds from its own copy of the zone, and each keeps the position and orientation the data gives it (`MapObjectSpawnTest.ARowTheServerSendsBecomesAnObjectThatReadsBackAsItsTemplatesClass`). The ten objects the data itself places at the origin are four sets modeled in zone space, the Commons' signs, birthday streamers and fireworks and the Lunar New Year decorations, and six monthly event warp portals whose templates hold no model, which the client reports as having no animation. Like 93 of the 123, the portals carry spawn requirements, which WLD-19 evaluates, so until then everyone sees them, as the risk below says. The same run of enter-world.json (run 20260926-194655) shows Ravenwood's 40, Bartleby, Merle Ambrose and the school teachers among them.
- [x] Real client: entering a zone with a Critical object leaves the loading screen (it does not hang). The same runs: the Commons' instance holds one object whose template's adjectives include Critical and Ravenwood's nine, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE names them in a CriticalObjectList, and the client loads the zone and says so with MSG_CLIENTZONED. The first run showed that the client reads CriticalObjects and MSG_NEWOBJECT's Data unwrapped: its MSG_LoginComplete handler decompresses Data before loading it but hands CriticalObjects straight to the plain serializer, and its MSG_NewObject handler reads Data as it arrives, so an envelope made it read the envelope's size as a class hash and its zlib header as a template id. `MapObjectSpawnTest.TheCriticalObjectListIsItsClassAndTheIdsUnwrapped` and the header bytes the first test checks hold both.
- [x] Unit: a zone_object with a missing template is logged once and skipped; the Map still loads. `MapObjectSpawnTest.ARowWhoseTemplateCannotBeReadIsReportedAndSkippedAndTheInstanceStillLoads`: a row naming a template the store cannot read is reported with its row and template, holds no mobile id, and the instance keeps its other object; `AMissingTemplateIsLoggedOnceHoweverManyInstancesAndRefreshesMeetIt`: two instances of the zone and a refresh meet the same missing template four times, and the log names it once.
- [x] Unit: after '.reload zone_object' adds one row and deletes another, a live Map holds the new object and not the deleted one, with no restart; a reload that fails validation leaves the Map unchanged. `MapObjectSpawnTest.RowsAReloadAddsAndDeletesChangeTheLiveInstanceAndNothingElse`: the deleted row's object leaves and its mobile id cools, the added row's object arrives, and the row the reload did not touch keeps its object; `AnEditedRowIsReplacedAndTheSameRowsTwiceChangeNothing` and `ATemplateThatReloadsDifferentlyReplacesItsObjectAndOneThatReloadsTheSameKeepsIt` do the same for an edited row and for templates, which reload apart from the rows. A reload that fails keeps the rows being served (`ZoneMgrDatabaseTest.ARowNamingAZoneNoTemplateHoldsFailsTheBuildAndKeepsWhatWasServing`), and `AnInstanceHoldingTheServedGenerationIsLeftAsItIs` shows an instance that already holds what is served is left as it is. The world tick sends each change to the wizards in the instance as MSG_REMOVEOBJECT and MSG_NEWOBJECT.
- [x] Server log: '<n> objects spawned in WizardCity/WC_Hub' matches the count of eligible zone_object rows. The Commons run's game server logs '123 objects spawned in WizardCity/WC_Hub, 1 of them critical', which the scenario expects, and `ZoneExtractorClientTest.TheCommonsHoldsItsObjectsAndPlaces` finds 123 of the Commons' 177 rows marked DYNAMIC_SERVER.

**Risks**

- That the client waits on CriticalObjects before dropping the loading screen is inferred from the reference, not confirmed
- Objects with m_spawnRequirements (quest-gated) are shown to everyone until WLD-19

## 5.03 Own movement tracking and persistence (WLD-9)

**Goal:** Server knows position; relog returns there.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 4.14, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_CLIENTMOVE, MSG_CLIENTMOVESTATE, MSG_JUMP

**Acceptance**

- [x] Real client: walk to the Ravenwood gate, relog, spawn there within a few units
- [x] Stale ZoneCounter leaves position unchanged
- [x] 1000 moves write nothing until the wizard leaves, then write once
- [x] A position write older than the stored one changes nothing

### Detailed spec from WLD-9: Own movement: position tracking and persistence

The server always knows where each player is, and a relog returns the player to the same spot.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/game/Handlers/MovementHandler.cpp: HandleClientMove (unpack, drop packets whose ZoneCounter differs from the session's), HandleClientMoveState, HandleJump
- src/server/game/Entities/Player/PlayerMovement, where the wizard stands, written to the characters DB when it leaves the world, never on a timer, under the next characters.state_revision (data/sql/updates/db_characters/2026_09_25_02.sql), as Saving in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md settles at the maintainer's direction; the write on a zone change is 6.07's, whose transfer saves the position
- src/server/game/Movement/MovementPacking brought to the client's own MoveBehavior constants, as Movement in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md records
- apps/clientdriver: a `restart_client` step and a `keep` on log waits, and walk-and-return.json, for the relog the real-client check needs
- Session zone counter bumped on every zone change

**Client messages:** MSG_CLIENTMOVE, MSG_CLIENTMOVESTATE, MSG_JUMP

**Database tables**

- characters.characters (position columns)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Real client: walk to the Ravenwood gate, log out, log back in, and spawn at that gate (within a few units). Earned on 2026-09-25 by the client driver's walk-and-return.json on r806919 (run 20260925-203406), in the Commons rather than at the gate, since what is checked is the place: the wizard stood at the zone's Start (-3.267008, 50.24604, -30.47341), walked into the pond with W, and the client was asked to quit, when the game server logged 'saved wizard 1 at (2460, -908, -64) facing 5.1 in WizardCity/WC_Hub after 20 move(s)'; the client was started again, logged in and pressed Play, and the game server put the wizard at (2460, -908, -64), the same place to the unit, where the screenshots before the quit and after the return show it standing at the same spot facing the same way
- [x] Unit: a MSG_CLIENTMOVE with a stale ZoneCounter leaves position unchanged. `PlayerMovementTest.AMoveUnderTheSessionsZoneCounterPlacesTheWizardAndAStaleOneIsIgnored`: a move under counter 1 while the session's is 0 leaves the wizard where it was, and after the counter becomes 1 a move under 0 is the stale one
- [x] Unit: 1000 moves write no position until the wizard leaves the world, and leaving writes it once. `PlayerMovementTest.AThousandMovesLeaveOneWriteThatIsTakenOnce`: a thousand moves leave one pending write holding the last place, which leaving the world takes once, and the move handler writes nothing; the real run's wizard was written once after its 20 moves
- [x] Unit: a position write older than the one stored changes nothing, so writes that land out of order leave the newest. `CharacterRepositoryDatabaseTest.APositionWriteOlderThanTheRowChangesNothing` against MariaDB: a write under revision 1 after one under 2 leaves the row, one under the same revision does too, and one under 3 lands

**Risks**

- Settled: the client sets its zone counter to 0 when it sends MSG_ATTACH, takes a new one only from MSG_UPDATEZONECOUNTER or a zone transfer, and stamps every move with it, as Movement in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md records.

## 5.04 Level, school and stat-config extractor (WIZ-2)

**Goal:** player_level_stats and magic_school_template.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 3.11, 2.07, 4.01, 4.15

**Acceptance**

- [x] Synthetic MagicXPConfig fixture emits expected rows
- [x] A row per (school, level) up to m_maxSchoolLevel; 16 magic_school_template rows
- [x] GetInfo(Fire,1) matches the row
- [x] `.reload player_level_stats` applies new base stats on the next level-up or login

### Detailed spec from WIZ-2: Level, school and stat-config extractor

The world database holds the per-school, per-level stat table and school definitions taken from the user's client, so the server can compute base health, mana, pip chance, training points and energy.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/ClientData/LevelExtractor and LevelViews, which the `extractor levels` command and the game server's first start both run, as Automatic setup settles for the name tables: reads Root.wad MagicXPConfig.xml (BINd, root class MagicXPConfig), walks m_classInfo and m_levelInfo (MagicLevelInfo: m_level, m_xpToLevel, m_hitpoints, m_mana, m_gold, m_pipChance, m_trainingPoints, m_craftingSlots, m_petEnergy, m_shadowPipRating, m_archmastery, pip conversion ratings), m_maxSchoolLevel and the rest of the class's settings, m_encounterXPFactors and m_levelsConfig; MagicSchools/*.xml (16 MagicSchoolTemplate: m_schoolName, m_minLevel, m_schoolIndex, m_secondarySchoolBadgeList); and WizStatisticEffectConfig.xml's settings and bands
- src/server/shared/Characters/PlayerLevels and StatEffects: the validating sets the extractor checks before it writes and the manager checks when it loads
- src/server/database/Extraction/LevelScript: the world SQL that replaces the nine tables in one transaction
- data/sql/updates/db_world/2026_09_25_01.sql: player_level_stats, magic_school_template, magic_school_badge, magic_xp_config, magic_xp_encounter_factor, mob_rank_level, stat_effect_config, stat_crit_block_band and stat_pip_conversion_band, in an update rather than data/sql/base because Database updates settles that every change is an update
- src/server/game/Entities/Player/PlayerLevelMgr (sPlayerLevelMgr) loaded at startup. `.reload player_level_stats` and `.reload stat_effect_config` rebuild a set off to the side, validate it, and swap it; a failure keeps the old set and reports every error.

**Data sources**

- Root.wad MagicXPConfig.xml (BINd, 358925 bytes, root MagicXPConfig)
- Root.wad MagicSchools/*.xml (16 files, root MagicSchoolTemplate)
- Root.wad WizStatisticEffectConfig.xml (root WizStatisticEffectConfig)
- A type dump generated by the project's own dumper (not committed)

**Database tables**

- world.player_level_stats
- world.magic_school_template, world.magic_school_badge
- world.magic_xp_config, world.magic_xp_encounter_factor, world.mob_rank_level
- world.stat_effect_config, world.stat_crit_block_band, world.stat_pip_conversion_band

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit test: the extractor, run on a synthetic BINd MagicXPConfig fixture built in the test, emits the expected rows. `LevelExtractorTest.EachSchoolTakesItsOwnValuesAndTheSharedTableOtherwise` encodes MagicXPConfig, two school templates and a WizStatisticEffectConfig through a type dump it writes: Fire's level 1 row takes its own 415 hitpoints and the shared table's experience, mana, gold and energy, Moon is named without rows, and the settings, factors, mob ranks, badges and bands come out in order; the script test checks the nine tables' SQL and the broken-input test each refusal
- [x] Run against the user's install: player_level_stats has a row for each (school, level) up to m_maxSchoolLevel, and magic_school_template has 16 rows. On r806919 `extractor --dry-run levels` prints 1267 rows for Fire, Ice, Storm, Life, Myth, Death and Balance, levels 0 to 180, and 16 magic_school_template rows, as `LevelExtractorClientTest` and the Extractor CTest check; the development game server, started on a world database without the tables, extracted and loaded them itself ('Extracted 1267 level rows for 7 schools, 16 magic schools and 39 stat settings', then 'Loaded 16 magic schools with level tables for 7 of them up to level 180, and 39 stat settings with 121 band values'), and level 1 reads 415, 500, 400, 425, 460, 450 and 480 hitpoints for Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death and Balance
- [x] Unit test: sPlayerLevelMgr.GetInfo(Fire, 1) returns hitpoints, mana and training points matching the imported row. `PlayerLevelMgrTest.RowsLoadAndAReloadAppliesEditsOrKeepsTheServingSet` against MariaDB loads the rows it writes and reads Fire's level 1 back with 415 hitpoints, 15 mana, 2 training points and every other column, and `LevelExtractorClientTest.TheRowsFillAWorldDatabaseTheManagerLoads` does the same with the install's own rows
- [x] Unit test: editing a player_level_stats row, then `.reload player_level_stats`, applies the new base stats on the next level-up or login without a restart; a row that fails validation keeps the old table. `PlayerLevelMgrTest.AReloadReachesTheNextWizardToEnterTheWorld` against MariaDB builds a Fire wizard's stats the way entering the world does, edits the level 1 row to 450 hitpoints, 16 mana and 3 training points, reloads the player_level_stats target, and the next wizard's stats carry the new values at full health while the stats built before keep 415; `PlayerLevelMgrTest.RowsLoadAndAReloadAppliesEditsOrKeepsTheServingSet` shows a gap, a badge out of order and a school id that is not its name's hash refused with the serving set kept

**Risks**

- Settled: m_classInfo holds one ClassInfo per magic school, named by m_className, and the client keys each by the hash of that name. Only the seven wizard schools list levels, and they set only their hitpoints and their own pip conversion rating, so each school's row takes the shared table's value wherever its own table leaves one unset, as Levels and stats in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md records with the client code that shows it.

## 5.05 Character state and player-object stats (WIZ-3)

**Goal:** HUD and character sheet show DB values.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 5.04, 4.11, 3.16, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_WIZGAMESTATS

**Acceptance**

- [x] New Fire level-1 base HP/mana/training points match player_level_stats(Fire,1)
- [x] WizGameStats round-trips all transmitted fields
- [x] Real client: gold=1234, level=5 shows on HUD, backpack and sheet

### Detailed spec from WIZ-3: Character state persistence and player-object stats

A logged-in character's level, school, XP, training points, gold, health, mana and potions load from the characters database into the player object, so the client HUD and character sheet show them.

**Deliverables**

- data/sql/updates/db_characters/2026_09_25_01.sql: character_stats (overflow_xp, secondary_school_id, training_points, gold, health, mana, potion_charge, potion_max, arena_points, level_locked, revision). Level, experience and school stay in characters, where the character list already reads them, so each has one home; health and mana are NULL when full.
- src/server/game/Entities/Player/PlayerStats: builds WizGameStats (m_baseHitpoints, m_baseMana, m_baseGoldPouch, m_energyMax, m_currentHitpoints, m_currentMana, m_currentGold, m_currentArenaPoints, m_powerPipBase, m_pipConversionBaseAllSchools, m_shadowPipRating, m_archmasteryBase, m_potionMax, m_potionCharge, m_referenceLevel, m_schoolID, m_secondarySchool, m_shadowPipMax) as WizClientObject.m_gameStats, and ClientMagicSchoolBehavior (m_schoolOfFocus, m_experiencePoints, m_level, m_trainingPoints, m_overflowXP, m_levelLocked, m_secondarySchool)
- GameSession reads the stats row through the wizard, so a failed read never passes for a wizard with no row, and refuses a wizard whose school has no level table
- Written as a stat changes and when the wizard leaves the world, never on a timer, each write carrying the next revision so writes that land out of order leave the newest, as Saving in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md settles at the maintainer's direction
- src/test/server/game/Entities/Player/PlayerStatsTest.cpp, src/test/client/PlayerStatsClientTest.cpp, and the client driver's wizard-stats.json, whose seeded wizard now carries experience and a stats row

**Client messages:** MSG_WIZGAMESTATS

**Data sources**

- world.player_level_stats from WIZ-2

**Database tables**

- characters.character_stats

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit test: a new Fire character at level 1 gets base HP, mana and training points equal to player_level_stats(Fire,1). `PlayerStatsTest.ANewFireWizardAtLevelOneTakesItsRowsBaseValuesAtFullHealthAndMana`: 415 hitpoints, its row's mana and training points, at full health and mana, saved back as full
- [x] Unit test: the ObjectProperty round-trip of the built WizGameStats keeps all transmitted fields. `PlayerStatsClientTest.TheClientsOwnStatsClassesCarryEveryValueThroughTheTransmitForm` fills r806919's own WizGameStats and ClientMagicSchoolBehavior from a level 5 wizard's stats and reads every transmitted property back unchanged; `PlayerStatsTest.TheGameStatsAndSchoolBehaviorCarryEveryValueAndReadBackThroughTheTransmitForm` does the same on classes the test lays out
- [x] Real client: a character with gold=1234 and level=5 in the DB logs in. The HUD health and mana globes show DB values over base maximums, the backpack shows 1234 gold, and the character sheet shows level 5 and the correct school. Earned on 2026-09-25 by the client driver's wizard-stats.json on r806919 (run 20260925-192225): a level 5 Fire wizard seeded with 900 experience, 1234 gold, 300 health and 10 mana entered Ravenwood, the game server logged 'level 5 with 300 of 503 health and 10 of 24 mana', the HUD globes read 300 and 10 partly drained, and the character stats page opened with C read Apprentice (Level 5), Pyromancer, Health 300/503, Mana 10/24, Experience 195/495, Gold 1,234/300,000 and Energy 0/42. The backpack opened with B shows its item count and no gold in this client revision, so the gold is read on the character stats page, where the client shows it

**Risks**

- Settled: the client shows each value against the maximum it computes itself, health as m_baseHitpoints plus m_bonusHitpoints (WizGameStats::CalcTotalHitpoints), mana as base plus bonus less its mana reduction (CalcMaxMana), energy as m_energyMax plus m_bonusEnergy (CalcMaxEnergy), and gold against m_baseGoldPouch, so the base values from the level tables are what it needs.
- Settled: the client hands MSG_WIZGAMESTATS to ClientDuelManager, which reads a duel participant's stats, so a player's own stats travel in its object in MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE.
- Current energy is not sent yet, so the character page reads 0 of the maximum; it belongs with the vitals in 8.01.

## 5.06 Return to character select (LOG-13)

**Goal:** Quit to select without credentials.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 2.14, 4.07, 5.03, 4.16

**Client messages:** MSG_QUERY_LOGOUT, MSG_CLIENT_DISCONNECT, MSG_USER_VALIDATE, MSG_USER_VALIDATE_RSP, MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND

**Acceptance**

- [x] PassKey3 from the stored key and this offer passes; previous offer, wrong key or other MachineID fails (ValidateHandlerDatabaseTest.APassKey3FromTheStoredKeyAndThisOfferIsAdmittedAndRenewsTheKey and ThePreviousOfferAWrongKeyAnotherMachineAndAnUnknownAccountAreRefused)
- [x] Real client: quit to select shows USER_VALIDATE -> VALIDATE_RSP Error=0 -> ADMIT_IND -> list, no password prompt (client driver run 20261001-120642, return-to-select.json: after Quit from the in-world menu the game server sent MSG_CLIENT_DISCONNECT before its MSG_QUERY_LOGOUT reply, the client sent MSG_USER_VALIDATE with an 88-byte PassKey3, the login server answered MSG_USER_VALIDATE_RSP Error=0 and MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND Status=1 and listed 1 character, and the character select screen came back with no login box)
- [x] DB online=0 with saved zone and position (client driver run 20261001-120642: characters.online answered 0, zone WizardCity/WC_Ravenwood, no realm_online_character row, and the save line gave the place the wizard walked to)
- [x] Changing Login.SessionKeyTTL applies from the next validate (ValidateHandlerDatabaseTest.LoweringTheLifetimeRefusesAnOlderKeyFromTheNextValidate; the spec's Login.SessionKeyTTL is the live setting Login.SessionKeyLifetime, which 2.12 built)

### Detailed spec from LOG-13: Return to character select: MSG_QUERY_LOGOUT and MSG_USER_VALIDATE

A player in game can quit to character select and land on the list without re-entering credentials, with the character saved and marked offline.

**Deliverables**

- Gameserver: HandleQueryLogout sends MSG_CLIENT_DISCONNECT, saves the character (zone, position, logout time), sets online=0 and removes it from realm_online_character; also on MSG_CLIENT_DISCONNECT and socket loss
- Loginserver AuthHandler::HandleUserValidate: load account by UserID; check bans and lock; load the account_session for (account, MachineID) and reject if missing or expired; verify PassKey3 against this new connection's SessionID and offer seconds and milliseconds; on success send MSG_USER_VALIDATE_RSP{Error=0, Reason='', UserID, TimeStamp='', PayingUser=1, Flags=0, SupportID=''} then MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND{Status=1, PositionInQueue=0}; on failure send only VALIDATE_RSP{Error!=0} and close (never fall through to success)
- Session key lifetime: Login.SessionKeyTTL, a live setting applied from the next validate; extend expires on each successful validate; revoke on password change or ban

**Client messages:** MSG_QUERY_LOGOUT, MSG_CLIENT_DISCONNECT, MSG_USER_VALIDATE, MSG_USER_VALIDATE_RSP, MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND

**Data sources**

- Sniffer capture lines 21852-21862

**Database tables**

- account_session
- characters
- realm_online_character
- account

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: a PassKey3 computed from the stored key and this session's offer passes; one computed from the previous connection's offer, a wrong key or a different MachineID fails (ValidateHandlerDatabaseTest.APassKey3FromTheStoredKeyAndThisOfferIsAdmittedAndRenewsTheKey and ThePreviousOfferAWrongKeyAnotherMachineAndAnUnknownAccountAreRefused)
- [x] Real client: in game, choose to quit to character select; the client reconnects to the loginserver and the log shows USER_VALIDATE -> VALIDATE_RSP Error=0 -> ADMIT_IND -> character list, matching capture lines 21852-21860; the select screen appears with no password prompt (client driver run 20261001-120642, return-to-select.json: after Quit from the in-world menu the game server sent MSG_CLIENT_DISCONNECT before its MSG_QUERY_LOGOUT reply, the client sent MSG_USER_VALIDATE with an 88-byte PassKey3, the login server answered MSG_USER_VALIDATE_RSP Error=0 and MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND Status=1 and listed 1 character, and the character select screen came back with no login box)
- [x] Real client: selecting the same wizard again enters the world at the saved position (client driver run 20261001-120642: Play put the wizard back in Ravenwood at the exact place the game server saved)
- [x] DB: after quitting, characters.online=0 and the saved zone and position reflect where the player stood (client driver run 20261001-120642: characters.online answered 0, zone WizardCity/WC_Ravenwood, no realm_online_character row, and the save line gave the place the wizard walked to)
- [x] Unit: lowering Login.SessionKeyTTL makes the next validate of an older key fail without a restart (ValidateHandlerDatabaseTest.LoweringTheLifetimeRefusesAnOlderKeyFromTheNextValidate; the spec's Login.SessionKeyTTL is the live setting Login.SessionKeyLifetime, which 2.12 built)

**Risks**

- The C->S game-side message that starts quit-to-select was not captured (the log only records S->C messages carrying blobs by default); MSG_QUERY_LOGOUT is inferred from the reference ClientService.
- The reference's validate handler sends success even after a failure. That bug must not be copied, and the tests must cover the failure path.

## 5.07 Binary type-registry cache (OBJ-15)

**Goal:** Fast startup, stale cache detected.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 3.03

**Acceptance**

- [x] Binary registry equals JSON registry (`TypeRegistryClientTest.TheBinaryCacheBuildsTheSameRegistryAsTheJsonDumpClassByClass`, client-gated: on the pinned r806919 dump it compared 2596 classes and 16495 properties, each class's kind, hash, bases and default sizes and each property's hash, id, offset, flags, container, type, bit width, defaults, enum options and text options, and found no difference)
- [x] Load under 200 ms; edited hash rejected (`TypeRegistryClientTest.TheBinaryCacheOfTheDumpLoadsInUnder200Milliseconds` in the windows-release build, client-gated: the pinned r806919 dump's binary cache loaded in a median of 102 ms over 7 loads, on a machine carrying two other builds)

### Detailed spec from OBJ-15: Binary type-registry cache

Server start does not re-parse the 13.8 MB JSON dump each time, and a revision mismatch is detected.

**Deliverables**

- src/tools/typeregbuild: converts the user's dump into a compact binary registry file in the user's data dir (never committed), stamped with the dump SHA-256 and client revision string
- TypeRegistry::LoadBinary with version and hash validation; falls back to JSON with a warning

**Acceptance**

- [x] Client-gated test: the binary registry equals the JSON-loaded registry (every class, property and enum table compared) (`TypeRegistryClientTest.TheBinaryCacheBuildsTheSameRegistryAsTheJsonDumpClassByClass`, client-gated: on the pinned r806919 dump it compared 2596 classes and 16495 properties, each class's kind, hash, bases and default sizes and each property's hash, id, offset, flags, container, type, bit width, defaults, enum options and text options, and found no difference)
- [x] Load time from binary is under 200 ms (`TypeRegistryClientTest.TheBinaryCacheOfTheDumpLoadsInUnder200Milliseconds` in the windows-release build, client-gated: the pinned r806919 dump's binary cache loaded in a median of 102 ms over 7 loads, on a machine carrying two other builds)
- [x] A deliberately stale cache (edited hash) is rejected with a clear message (TypeRegistryBinaryTest.RoundTripsTheRegistryAndRejectsAnEditedPayload and .FallsBackToJsonForMissingOrStaleCaches; a truncated, a bit-flipped and a random cache built from the pinned install's dump are each refused by name and the JSON dump keeps serving)

## 5.08 Installer (FND-22)

**Goal:** Clone to running servers with one script.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 2.08

**Acceptance**

- [ ] Clean Ubuntu and Windows reach 'ready' on all 3 apps
- [x] `conf` twice never overwrites an edited .conf (`apps/installer/tests/test_installer.py`, which builds a prefix of templates, runs conf, edits a .conf and runs conf again, against both scripts)

### Detailed spec from FND-22: apps/installer: one-command build, config copy and DB setup

A new contributor goes from clone to running servers with one script on Windows or Linux.

**Deliverables**

- apps/installer/ambrose.sh and ambrose.ps1: `deps` (check CMake, compiler, Boost, OpenSSL, MySQL connector, and optionally install them), `compile` (preset build and install to env/dist), `conf` (copy *.conf.dist to *.conf if missing), `db` (run dbimport), `run <app>` (a restart-on-crash loop is optional)
- conf/dist/env.dist consumed by the installer (install prefix, build type, preset)
- doc/INSTALL.md with the Markdown header

**Acceptance**

- [ ] On a clean Ubuntu VM and a clean Windows machine, following doc/INSTALL.md with the installer yields running loginserver, gameserver and patchserver that log 'ready'
- [x] Running `conf` twice never overwrites an edited .conf (`apps/installer/tests/test_installer.py`, which builds a prefix of templates, runs conf, edits a .conf and runs conf again, against both scripts)
- [x] Real client: n/a (5.08 installs, configures and starts the servers and shows a client nothing; the first behavior a client sees arrives with NET/LOG)

**Progress**

- The Ubuntu half was shown on 2026-10-01: `apps/installer/tests/clean_ubuntu.sh` runs the INSTALL.md steps in a fresh ubuntu:24.04 container against the user's own install, read-only, and against r806919 it reached 'loginserver ready', 'patchserver ready' and 'gameserver ready'. The run is not in the tree. Getting there fixed two things: the installers installed `--config Release` while the release presets build RelWithDebInfo (709eed2b), and `deps --install` now takes patchelf from apt so vcpkg never downloads it. Against r801440 the login server had no type dump, because typeextract cannot derive that revision's layout; that is the derived-offsets check of 3.28. The two clean-machine checks stay open until a clean Windows 11 machine reaches 'ready' as well.

**Risks**

- Installing system packages differs per distro; limit support to a declared set
