<!-- Project Ambrose by Imjustchico: Every live setting, written from the declarations in src/server/shared/Settings. -->
# Live settings

Every setting here can be changed while its app runs with `.settings set <key> <value> [reason]` in game or `settings set` on the app's console, and returned to its config value with `settings reset`. A change is checked against the type and bounds below, persisted in the `settings` table of the database the app owns (`characters` for the game server, `login` for the login server, and the panel store for the supervisor), and written to `setting_audit` with who made it and why. A setting also set by an `AMBROSE_` environment variable or a command-line override is locked and cannot be changed live. The layers are described in [README.md](README.md).

Applies says when a change takes hold: live at once, or from the next connection or operation that reads it.

Access says who may see and change a setting over the admin API and the panel. A secret's value is shown masked, in `setting_audit` too, unless the caller asks for it with the right to see secrets, and every such reveal is audited. The admin and panel tokens and the password in each database connection string are secrets too, although only config holds them, and are masked the same way wherever they are shown, a configuration file read through the panel included. A restricted setting is one whose wrong value stops the app or locks players out, so changing it takes its own right besides the right to change settings.
