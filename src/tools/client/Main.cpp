 * Project Ambrose by Imjustchico
 * Asks the user's own Wizard101 install a question and prints the answer. One tool rather than one per question, because every one of them needs the same three things first, the install, its type dump and an archive out of it, and a question nobody can ask is a wall that stops a milestone rather than a gap in a list. `field` reads a message field's object from a file, as its own rules say. `hash` gives the hash the client gives a class or school name, or a property's hash from its type and name, with no install. `types` searches and prints the classes the dump holds, which is the only way to read it at all: it is keyed by hash, so no search of the file itself finds a name; given a hash the dump does not list, it reads the client program itself for a name that hashes to it, including the mangled form the runtime keeps class names in, where a leading AV or AU stands for class or struct, so an unknown class is reported by name rather than as a number nobody can act on. `messages` prints what the client says a message carries, read from the client's own XML rather than from anybody's notes, under the protocol, service and order the servers give it, worked out by the same definition code they load the XML with, so the numbers a capture or a log shows can be matched to a name without counting tags by hand. `handlers` says which classes in the client program handle a message and where, found the way the program registers them: each handler goes in under a debug name such as WizardGraphicalClient::MSG_TimedAccessPasses, with its plain name and a pointer to the function, so client-image finds the code that reads both names and the function address it loads, and a behavior's handler goes in under a key such as RidableBehavior_MSG_RidersList, found the same way with its plain name read after the key, and the answer is written once per revision; a message nothing registers that way is one the client only sends or registers some other way, which the tool says rather than guessing which. `behaviors` says which class the client program builds for each behavior it registers, by following each behavior's name to the factory the program stores for it, the vtable that factory's create function gives the object and the class name its GetType registers, with the bases each GetType registers its class under, which is how a behavior a template names is known to become a given client class without a capture of it; when the dump does not list that class, the nearest base it does list is named, since that is the class whose properties the dump can describe; for a name it registers nothing under, it says whether the program holds that name at all, since a name the program never holds is one it cannot key a factory by, which is how a behavior only the server runs is told from one the tool cannot follow yet. `template` prints the object template an id names, found through TemplateManifest.xml the way the client and the game server find it, in Root.wad or in the World-Part.wad a path written |World|Part|path names, with its file, archive, object name and behaviors, then the template itself, so a zone object's template id can be read without searching the manifest by hand; it reads them through the game server's own template store, and its list prints every id the manifest holds with the archive and entry it names, marking each the install lacks, which is how a streamed archive not yet fetched shows up. `wizbangs` prints the markers WizBangs.xml gives the client, each under the id a MSG_WIZBANG names it by, the string hash of its name, which the client's SetWizBang looks the template up by, and the model it draws, and says of a name or id no marker has that it draws nothing, which is how 6.02 found the client has no spellbook marker. `strings`, `xrefs`, `disasm`, `functions` and `decompile` read the client program's code, so what the client does is asked of the tool rather than worked out by hand: `strings` finds the text the program holds with each instruction that reads it, `xrefs` every instruction and relocated pointer that reaches an address, `disasm` a function in Intel syntax with the strings, imports, handlers and behavior classes it reaches named, `functions` a function by the name its own log lines give it, and `decompile` a function as C through the user's own Ghidra, started directly with the Java Ghidra picks rather than through its launch scripts, over a project the tool makes once or one it is given, keeping each function's C so asking again takes seconds; the names functions log under are found once per revision and written to the Ambrose data folder. `types --derived` lists every class derived from one and `--flag` the properties that carry a property flag. `name` names a property hash the way the property oracle does, from every type and name the dump lists, every property name the client program holds or prints and every one the install's text files spell out, `--wide` adding every class the dump lists as a type, plain, pointed to and shared, and it says how often a random hash is named by the same sources, so a lone answer from a wide search is read as the chance it is. `lang` prints the text behind a locale key, because most of the client's data carries an id where a person expects words, and searches the keys by the text they hold. `wad` lists and prints archive entries, BINd as JSON, an object stored with no BINd header as JSON too, which is how a zone's gamedata.bin is kept, and anything else as the text it holds. `core` prints a game object blob, what MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE and MSG_NEWOBJECT carry, whose every object opens with the client's CoreObject header, a core type, a template type and a template id, rather than a class hash; it opens the envelope itself when there is one, reads which class each core type builds from the world database's core_object_type when it is given the world database, and when a core type builds a class nobody has named yet it lists the classes the dump derives from CoreObject rather than guessing, so the one that decodes can be named with --core-type or, for the root, --as. Given the world database, every command also reads the classes its server_class tables describe for the dump, and types marks them as coming from there; without it, the classes the install holds that its dump does not describe join the dump from the class file schemaprobe builds for the install's revision in the Ambrose data folder, when there is one, so a template shows every behavior it holds as the game server reads it. Reading a headerless object needs no flag because it proves itself: the bytes decode only if they open with a class hash the dump knows and the whole object parses, so a wrong guess refuses rather than printing rubble. Each command is meant to grow and new ones to join them, so the next thing the client work needs is taught here rather than worked around where it was needed. What this install's messages carry is written once to the Ambrose data folder and read from there afterwards, and a type dump is read through the fast copy beside it, which is built once if it is not there, so asking a second question costs a fraction of the first rather than the same six seconds again.

Asks your own Wizard101 install a question and prints the answer.

Commands:
  hash <text>...         print the hash the client gives a class or school name, or with
                         type:name, such as "enum CoreObjectInfo::LoadingType:m_loadingType",
                         the hash of a property of that type and name; needs no install
  types <pattern>...     print every class whose name holds a pattern, or a hash
  types --list <pattern> print only the names, one per line
  name <hash>...         name a property hash from every type and name the dump lists,
                         every property name the client program holds and every one the
                         install's text files spell out, saying how often a random hash is
                         named by the same sources; --wide also tries every class the dump
                         lists as a type
  messages <tag>...      print what the client says a message carries, with its
                         protocol, service and order
  messages --list [text] print every message tag with its service and order, or those
                         holding the text
  handlers <tag>...      print which classes in the client program handle a message
                         and the address of each handler, or name a class or a
                         handler name instead of a tag
  handlers --list [text] print every handler the client program registers
  template <id>...       print the object template an id names, found through
                         TemplateManifest.xml, with its archive, file, name and behaviors
  template --list [text] print every template id the manifest lists with its archive and
                         entry, or those holding the text, marking each the install lacks
  wizbangs <name>...     print the wizbang markers WizBangs.xml gives the client, each with
                         the id MSG_WIZBANG names it by, the hash of its name, and the
                         model it draws; a name or id it has not is said to draw nothing
  wizbangs --list [text] print every marker, or those whose name holds the text
  strings <text>...      print every string the client program holds with the text, with
                         its address and each instruction that reads it; --list prints
                         only the strings
  xrefs <address>...     print every instruction that reads, calls or jumps to an address,
                         0x hex, or to each string holding the text given, and its function
  disasm <address>...    print the function an address is in, or each function that reads
                         a string holding the text given, in Intel syntax, naming the
                         strings, imports, handlers and behavior classes it reaches
  decompile <address>... print the same functions as C, decompiled by your own Ghidra and
                         kept, so asking again is instant
  functions <name>...    print the functions that log under a name holding the text, such
                         as CoreObject::OnPostLoad, or the names the function holding an
                         address logs under, found from the client's own log lines
  vtable <address>...    print a virtual table slot by slot, from its address, 0x hex, or
                         from the class it belongs to, a behavior's class or the name the
                         program's run-time type information gives, naming each function,
                         showing the short ones and marking the slots only it holds
  behaviors <name>...    print the class the client program builds for a behavior it
                         registers, and where it found each link, or whether the
                         program holds the name at all where it registers none
  behaviors --list [text] print every behavior the client program registers
  wad <entry>...         print an archive entry: BINd and headerless objects as JSON,
                         the rest as text, and each value no class names by its bits
                         with what they read as
  wad --list [pattern]   print entry names holding the pattern
  lang <key>             print the text a locale key holds, which is what the client
                         shows where the data carries only an id
  lang --list [text]     print the keys whose text holds the pattern
  core <file>...         print a game object blob, the Data a MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE or a
                         MSG_NEWOBJECT carries, enveloped or not, with the block, type
                         and template its header names; --as names the class they stand for
  field <tag> <field> <file>...
                         print a message field's object from a file, with its envelope or
                         without, read as the field's own rules say, such as MSG_BADGES BadgeInfo
  hex <file>...          print a file's bytes with their offsets, from --from for --count,
                         or with --wad an archive entry's, such as one no class reads yet

Options:
  --client <dir>       the install to read (default: AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR)
  --type-dump <file>   the type dump made from it (default: AMBROSE_TYPE_DUMP_PATH)
  --supplement <file>  a class file in the type dump's format, such as schemaprobe
                       --server-classes writes, whose classes join the dump in place of
                       the one the Ambrose data folder holds for the install
  --wad <file>         the archive wad and name read (default: Root.wad), and hex when given
  --locale <name>      the locale lang reads (default: en-US)
  --all                print every match rather than the first few
  --as <class>         the class a game object's core type builds, such as
                       "class WizClientObject"
  --trailing           let core stop where the class ends and go on to read each object
                       that follows it the same way, as MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE's Data holds the
                       player and then its stats, saying where bytes are left that do not
                       read, which is how a class that ends early is told from a wrong one
  --mask <n>           read core with this property flag mask rather than the one the
                       server sends a player's own object with, Transmit|AuthorityTransmit
                       (decimal or 0x hex)
  --core-type <n>=<class>
                       the class a core type builds wherever it opens an object in a
                       core blob, such as 115="class WizClientObjectItem"; repeatable,
                       and it takes the place of the world database's row for that type
  --wide               with name, also try every class the dump lists as a type, plain,
                       pointed to and shared, which names far more hashes by chance
  --words              with name, also try names built from the words of every name the
                       sources give, m_ and one or two words, against --type or the plain
                       scalar types, saying how often chance alone would name a hash
  --type <type>        with --words, a type to try instead of the scalar ones; repeatable
  --anchor <word>      with --words, also try three words with this one in any place;
                       repeatable, and each makes a match by chance more likely
  --derived            with types, print every class derived from each class named
  --flag <name>        with types, print only the properties that carry a property flag,
                       such as ObjectName, of the classes found
  --ghidra <dir>       the Ghidra install decompile runs (default: AMBROSE_GHIDRA_DIR)
  --ghidra-project <file>
                       the Ghidra project decompile reads, its .gpr file (default:
                       AMBROSE_GHIDRA_PROJECT, else one the tool makes in the Ambrose data
                       folder by importing and analyzing the client program, once)
  --world-db <info>    the world database, host;port;user;password;database, whose
                       server_class, core_object_type and core_template_type rows join
                       what the dump says
                       (default: AMBROSE_WORLD_DATABASE_INFO)
  --flags <n>          read core with exactly these serializer flags rather than trying
                       the plain form and then a stream that opens with its own flags
  --from <n>, --count <n>
                       where hex starts and how many bytes it prints (decimal or 0x hex)
  --help               print this text
